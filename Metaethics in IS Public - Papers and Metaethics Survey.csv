Couger J.D.,Preparing IS students to deal with ethical issues,1989,MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems,5,65,"The recent series of ethics violations in business (e.g., insider trading) has caused a number of firms to begin courses in ethics for employees. Unless professionals improve their ethical practices, legislation will force them to do so. The ACM and DPMA curriculum recommendations include ethics topics. An important issue is the proper education of IS students to deal with on-the-job ethical situations. Unfortunately, ethics education gets lost among the myriad of subjects to be taught in IS courses. But there is an effective pedagogical approach for this material. The approach requires students to determine how they would act in various ethical scenarios. This ""personalization"" method may be the first step toward proper ethical behavior in the workplace. While not a rigorous scientific treatment of the subject, the classroom experiences reported here may be helpful for IS faculty and IS trainers as they develop improved ethics instruction.","Computer and Management Science, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO 80933, United States",Ethics; Training,,Ethical issues,Article,IS education,Students,USA,Normative,Deontology; professional ethics,Case based,Conceptual; pedagogical,Education,0,0,0,1,Cognitivism; Relativism,Implicit
Straub Jr. D.W.,Effective IS security: An empirical study,1990,Information Systems Research,21,604,"Information security has not been a high priority for most managers. Many permit their installations to be either lightly protected or wholly unprotected, apparently willing to risk major losses from computer abuse. This study, based on the criminological theory of general deterrence, investigates whether a management decision to invest in IS security results in more effective control of computer abuse. Data gathered through a survey of 1, 211 randomly selected organizations indicates that security countermeasures that include deterrent administrative procedures and preventive security software will result in significantly lower computer abuse. Knowledge about these relationships is useful for making key decisions about the security function. Copyright © 1990, The Institute of Management Sciences.","Curtis L.

Oz E.,Ethical standards for information systems professionals: A case for a unified code,1992,MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems,10,71,"Professions have adopted ethical codes and codes of conduct. Physicians, lawyers, and engineers have moral responsibilities and know to whom they are responsible. Professionals in the information systems field need similar guidance. Unfortunately, multiple professional standards in the field are offered by individual organizations. Many of the precepts in these codes are similar, but some are not. This article presents the principles of five codes: three U.S. codes, the Canadian code, and the British code. After an examination of their similarities and differences, it is proposed that we (1) resolve the differences and (2) adopt a single, coherent, international code of ethics for the information systems community.","Department of Accounting, School of Business Administration, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202, United States",,,Issues Opinion,Article,IS professionalism,Organization; society,USA,Normative,Deontology; professional ethics,Conceptual analysis,Conceptual; policy,Cross national,0,0,0,1,Realism,Implicit
Wong E.Y.W.; Tate G.,A study of user participation in information systems development,1994,Journal of Information Technology,9,21,"User participation in information system development is considered to be an important factor influencing implementation success or failure. The ETHICS (Effective Technical and Human Implementation of Computer-based Systems) method was developed as a guide to user involvement in system design. A case study of successful implementation which did not use the ETHICS method explicitly is described. The case study and the ETHICS methodology are then compared and contrasted in an attempt to gain greater insight into user participation and to understand why the implementation was successful. Furthermore, techniques of software process modelling are applied to both ETHICS and the case study with the intention of more closely defining the user participation process and potentially also guiding it in future developments.

Hirschheim R.; Klein H.K.,Realizing emancipatory principles in information systems development: The case for ETHICS,1994,MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems,22,264,"Information systems development methodologies have been the subject of much attention over the years. A substantial body of research has focused on the need to develop methodologies that support viewing information systems as social constructs, and information systems development (ISD) as a social process. But if development is a social process, what principles/ideals should inform it? Recent research has called for ""emancipatory"" ideals to be included. This debate can be expanded to explore not only what emancipatory principles might be applied in information systems development, but also how. Existing ISD methodologies only partially embrace emancipatory principles. One of these - ETHICS - seems the most likely candidate to be extended or "" reformulated"" to achieve emancipatory ideals more comprehensively. Organizations using this reformulated version of ETHICS should make some progress advancing emancipation while at the same time confronting limited resources and the presence of power and authority. The approach undertaken here is generic; researchers can similarly apply these reformulation techniques to other methodologies based on other paradigms.","College of Business Administration, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204-6283, United States; School of Management, State University of New York, Binghamton, NY 13902, United States",Critical social theory; Emancipation; Information systems development; Methodology reformulation; Neohumanism; Participation; Socio-technical design,,NA,Article,IS development,Societal; organization,Scandinavia,Normative,Critical theory; discourse ethics,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Constructivism,Implicit
Conger S.; Loch K.D.; Helft B.L.,Ethics and information technology use: a factor analysis of attitudes to computer use,1995,Information Systems Journal,22,64,"Abstract.  In 1986 Richard O. Mason identified privacy, accuracy, property and access as four ethical issues for the information age. The research reported here sought to answer the questions: are these social issues empirically verifiable constructs? Second, what consensus exists on the factors? A field survey of 79 business professionals and students identified 12 factors which were grouped into five clusters: ownership, access, motivation, responsibility and privacy. These constructs identify additional dimensions and complexity to extend Mason's definition of key ethical issues. The importance of separating the computer user who experiences the ethical dilemma from the stakeholder(s) who deal with the consequences of the dilemma is identified. This study also demonstrates some consensus within the survey items. Consensus exists that it is unethical to profit from non‐job, computer‐related acts. Consensus also exists that personal use of company‐owned information technology resources is acceptable. The other items show little consensus, identifying areas of necessary discussion within the computing professions to determine ethically consistent and appropriate computer uses.

Benbasat I.; Weber R.,"Research Commentary: Rethinking ""Diversity"" in Information Systems Research",1996,Information Systems Research,10,272,"Three types of diversity have been prominent in the Information Systems discipline for over a decade: (a) diversity in the problems addressed; (b) diversity in the theoretical foundations and reference disciplines used to account for IS phenomena; and (c) diversity in the methods used to collect, analyze, and interpret data. History has played a major part in encouraging IS researchers to use diversity as a means of countering criticisms of their discipline and increasing their research rigor and productivity. In particular, frequent recourse to reference disciplines has underpinned much of the research that has been undertaken since the early 1980s. There are now signs, however, that the level of diversity that currently exists in IS research may be problematic. In this paper, we consider some of the benefits and costs of allowing diversity to reign in the IS discipline. We also propose a structure that we hope will facilitate discourse on the benefits and costs of diversity and on the role that diversity should now play in the IS discipline.","Fac. of Comm. and Bus.

Harrington S.J.,The effect of codes of ethics and personal denial of responsibility on computer abuse judgments and intentions,1996,MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems,20,321,"This research asks whether codes of ethics affect computer abuse judgments and intentions of information systems (IS) employees. Codes of ethics examined include both company codes of ethics and those written specifically to deal with IS issues. In addition, since the intent of codes of ethics is to clarify responsibility and deter unethical behavior, both the psychological trait of responsibility denial and its moderating effect on codes was studied. While company codes did not affect the computer abuse judgments and intentions of all IS personnel, they did affect those IS personnel who tend to deny responsibility, thus suggesting that company codes may clarify responsibility and reduce rationalizations for some people. Unlike company codes, IS-specific codes of ethics had a direct effect on computer sabotage judgments and intentions, but had no differential effect on those high in responsibility denial. Finally, responsibility denial was directly related to all computer abuse judgments and intentions studied. Overall, codes had little effect on computer abuse judgments and intentions relative to the psychological trait of responsibility denial.","Georgia College, State University, Milledgeville, GA 31061-9337, 3690 Sussex Drive NE, United States; Georgia College, State University, Milledgeville, GA, United States",Abuse and crime; Codes of ethics; Computer crime; Deterrence; IS security; Management of security; Responsibility,Codes (standards); Computer viruses; Personnel; Problem solving; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Codes of ethics; Computer abuse; Information systems (IS); Computer crime,Research article,Article,IS security,Individual,USA,Empirical descriptive,Deterrence theory,Survey; vignettes,Empirical,Corporate IT departments,0,0,0,1,Non-cognitivism,Implicit

Smith H.J.; Milberg S.J.; Burke S.J.,Information privacy: Measuring individuals' concerns about organizational practices,1996,MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems,28,1777,"Information privacy has been called one of the most important ethical issues of the informa-tion age. Public opinion polls show rising levels of concern about privacy among Americans. Against this backdrop, research into issues associated with information privacy is increasing. Based on a number of preliminary studies, it has become apparent that organizational practices, individuals' perceptions of these practices, and societal responses are inextricably linked in many ways. Theories regarding these relationships are slowly emerging. Unfortunately, researchers attempting to examine such relationships through confirmatory empirical approaches may be impeded by the lack of validated instruments for measuring individuals' concerns about organizational information privacy practices. To enable future studies in the information privacy research stream, we developed and validated an instrument that identifies and measures the primary dimensions of individuals' concerns about organizational information privacy practices. The development process included examinations of privacy literature; experience surveys and focus groups; and the use of expert judges. The result was a parsimonious 15-item instrument with four sub-scales tapping into dimensions of individuals' concerns about organizational information privacy practices. The instrument was rigorously tested and validated across several heterogenous populations, providing a high degree of confidence in the scales' validity, reliability, and generalizability.","Georgetown School of Business, Georgetown University, Old North Hall, Washington, DC 20057, United States; School of Business, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, United States",Ethical issues; LISREL; Measures; Privacy; Reliability; Validity,Data processing; Information management; Problem solving; Public policy; Reliability; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Ethical issues; LISREL; Measures; Validity; Data privacy,Research article,Article,Privacy,Individual,USA,Empirical descriptive,None,Survey; factor anlysis,Empirical; methodological,Finance,0,0,0,0,Non-cognitivism,Implicit

Tuttle B.; Harrell A.; Harrison P.,"Moral hazard, ethical considerations, and the decision to implement an information system",1997,Journal of Management Information Systems,20,45,"A decision-making study was conducted to examine the effects of moral hazard on information systems (IS) professionals' decisions whether or not to implement a system with quality problems. Moral hazard was defined as an incentive to act in one's self-interest in conflict with the organization's overall goals while being able to hide those actions through privately held information. Highly experienced IS professionals provided responses to a hypothetical decision case that revealed a tendency to implement a project with quality problems in a moral hazard situation. Their decisions, however, were strongly influenced by ethical considerations. These findings suggest that key economic constructs, such as moral hazard, apply to system implementation contexts. They also suggest that organizations can significantly moderate self-interested behavior by fostering an ethical climate.","Department of Accounting, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, United States; Arizona State University; University of Texas, Austin, TX, United States",Agency theory; Computer ethics; Incentives; Information system implementation; Information system quality; Moral hazard,,Research article,Article,IS implementation,Individual,USA,Empirical descriptive,Deontology (contractualism); agency theory,Experiment; hypothetical scenarios,Empirical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Non-cognitivism,Implicit

The results show support for the applicability of the tested ethical decision-making theory to the domain of IS, specifically in the context of softlifting. Entry-level IS professionals were found to use both deontological and teleological evaluations to arrive at an ethical judgment of a moral issue. Subsequently, moral intention to pursue softlifting behavior is primarily determined by the ethical judgment.

Gopal R.D.; Sanders G.L.,International Software Piracy: Analysis of Key Issues and Impacts,1998,Information Systems Research,17,175,"The pervasiveness of software piracy throughout the world is having a profound effect on the software publishing industry and the development of digital intellectual properties and technologies - especially in developing countries, where the piracy rates are extremely high. An economic model is first presented that incorporates the incentive structures for governments, software publishers, and individual consumers. The analytical model provides the economic rationale for the reluctance of a number of governments to aggressively enact and enforce intellectual property rights. An important proposition derived from the analysis states that the government's incentive to enact and enforce copyright laws are closely related to the size of the domestic software industry. The ensuing empirical study provides support for the proposition and further suggests that this relationship holds regardless of the income levels of the countries. Our analysis reveals that alliances between foreign and domestic software publishers through product relationships can be mutually beneficial and will provide an environment of increased copyright enforcement. These results provide a viable strategy to combat global software piracy. With strong policies on copyright enforcement, and a vigorous promotion of alliances between foreign and domestic publishers, a government can increase the net welfare of the country and help establish a strong domestic software industry. Through product relationships with domestic publishers, a foreign publisher can improve profits and operate in an environment of increased intellectual property protection. We then present a general model of ethical behavior related to the impact of behavioral and cultural factors on software piracy. The purpose of this model is to examine whether these determinants of piracy behavior are supranational and transcend cultural and ethical barriers. An empirical study involving U.S. and Indian graduate students suggests that the general model of ethics as related to software piracy is valid in the United States. However, the model results from the Indian sample suggest that additional cross-cultural research with revised models and improved scales is necessary.","Dept. of Operations and Info.

Gattiker U.E.; Kelley H.,Morality and Computers: Attitudes and Differences in Moral Judgments,1999,Information Systems Research,21,105,"Business ethics is an emerging area of research in many subfields of management, including information systems (IS). Empirical IS research has studied differences in users' attitudes and in moral judgments regarding ethical computer-related behavior. This study applied the ""domains of morality"" approach to determine how users felt about certain computer-related behaviors. Vignettes describing ethical dilemmas involving computer technology (e.g., uploading a computer virus on an electronic network/bulletin board system) were presented to a sample of Internet users. The research findings offered several interesting and, in some cases, unexpected results. The empirical results indicated that older computer users have a less permissive sense of what is right and wrong for an illegal game. When computers were used to test a banned game, men and women differed in their assessment of its appropriateness. A surprising finding was that participants were not likely to endorse civil liberties, and were more concerned about the harm to, and violations of, social norms when the scenario described a situation involving a computer virus. How users perceive, prejudge, and discriminate computer ethics and abusive computer actions raises numerous questions and implications for IS researchers, IS practitioners, and policy makers. The results of this study foster a better understanding of Internet users' moral categorization of specific computer behaviors and, hopefully, help to further reduce risks and vulnerabilities of systems by identifying computer actions deemed ethically acceptable by users. Opportunities for IS researchers to further explore this timely issue are also discussed.","Department of Production, Aalborg University, DK-9220 Aalborg, Fibigerstraede 16, Denmark; University of Lethbridge, Faculty of Management, Lethbridge, Alta.

However, linkages to the normative theories of business ethics, which can be used in resolving these quandaries in the corporate domain, have been lacking. This paper enumerates and explains the three major normative theories. The stockholder theory holds that managers should resolve ethical quandaries by taking actions which increase the long-term profits to the stockholders without violating the law or engaging in fraud or deception. The stakeholder theory claims that managers should resolve ethical quandaries by balancing stakeholder interests without violating the rights of any stakeholder. The social contract theory states that managers should increase social welfare above what it would be in the absence of the existence of corporations without violating the basic canons of justice. The application of these theories-to IS-related ethical quandaries is discussed and a specific quandary dealing with a real-world example - Blockbuster Video's reported plans to market customer lists - is explored in depth.

The purpose of the project was to design appropriate organizational structures and functions and an accompanying information system (IS), to increase the effectiveness of the existing service. A participative sociotechnical approach was adopted for the entire design process which was carried out by the practitioners themselves. The staff-s views were elicited during informal participatory group sessions as well as in one-to-one informal discussions. While ETHICS was the overall guiding methodology for the design, QUICKethics was used as a complementary means of analysing the requirements of the new IS.

Saravanamuthu K.,The political lacuna in participatory systems design,2002,Journal of Information Technology,13,20,"This paper critiques three prominent information systems (IS) contributions to the development of social (work) systems, namely ETHICS, UTOPIA and Multiple Perspectives. They are based on the socio-technical Quality of Working Life and generally rely on systems design for improving working conditions by allowing employees to appreciate a holistic work experience, instead of being treated as a cog in the profit-making machinery of capitalism. However, this paper argues that ETHICS and Multiple Perspectives in fact shy away from the ideo-political differences that cause workplace conflict in the first place. Their pluralist means of resolving workplace conflicts through discussion and negotiation fail to problematize the colonizing or hegemonic influence of economic rationalism in obscuring the feasibility of alternative modes of workplace relations. They play down the asymmetrical power relations that perpetuate the exploitation of weaker stakeholders in real-life employment negotiations. Hence, political quietism in social IS approaches fail to acknowledge the ideological causes of conflict, that is the pursuit of profit at any cost, as opposed to a more sustainable and ethical approach to workplace relations. This paper presents a study of an organizational accounting IS system and uses it for illustrating the ideological roots of differences in employee-employer needs and priorities and revealing how reflexive decision makers are alienated when they attempt to distance themselves from the myopic ethos of economic rationalism. Despite these criticisms, the paper concludes on a relatively positive note. It argues that, since the Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future was released in 1987, there has been increased awareness that organizations cannot continue to exploit our resources (and ourselves) blatantly in the name of profit maximization. This process of redefinition opens the door for more realistic and politically challenging systems approaches.","Sch. of Acco., Fin./Entrepreneurship, University of New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",,Decision making; Industrial economics; Personnel; Systems analysis; Information systems (IS); Information technology,Research article,Article,IS implementation,Organization; society,Australia,Normative,Marxist labor process theory; critical theory; postmodern critique,Critical interpretive analysis; case study,Theoretical,Automotive,0,0,0,0,Anti-realism; Non-cognitivism,Implicit
Stewart K.A.; Segars A.H.,An empirical examination of the concern for information privacy instrument,2002,Information Systems Research,13,578,"The arrival of the ""information age"" holds great promise in terms of providing organizations with access to a wealth of information stores. However, the free exchange of electronic information also brings the threat of providing easy, and many times unwanted, access to personal information. Given the potential backlash of consumers, it is imperative that both researchers and practitioners understand the nature of consumers' concern for information privacy and accurately model the construct within evolving research and business contexts. Drawing upon a sample of 355 consumers and working within the framework of confirmatory factor analysis, this study examines the factor structure of the concern for information privacy (CFIP) instrument posited by Smith et al. (1996). Consistent with prior findings, the results suggest that each dimension of this instrument is reliable and distinct. However, the results also suggest that CFIP may be more parsimoniously represented as a higher-order factor structure rather than a correlated set of first-order factors. The implication of these results is that each dimension of CFIP as well as the supra dimension derived from the associations among dimensions are important in capturing CFIP and associating the construct to other important antecedents and consequences.","College of Business Administration, Computer Info.

Varey R.J.; Wood-Harper T.; Wood B.,A theoretical review of management and information systems using a critical communications theory,2002,Journal of Information Technology,10,41,"This paper reflects on the managerialistic orthodoxy of knowledge management in order to show that a critical communications theory is required for addressing real political and ethical shortcomings. This produces an alternative methodological perspective through an intentional synthesis of established methodological views. The paper's allies in this critical quest include Jürgen Habermas, Werner Ulrich, Stanley Deetz, Geoffrey Vickers, Peter Checkland and their mentors. Information systems and knowledge systems architects and engineers and their manager clients conveniently ignore fundamental issues, including politics, power, knowledge and communication. Yet, today the more substantive issues are not technical but ethical. In raising questions about the rhetoric of knowledge management reflections on the instrumentality of much of what is said and done about management and information systems are outlined. The departure point is critical scepticism. This is motivated by concerns for the ethical status of the commercially valuable outcome of (at least) two conjoined simplistic and fundamentally dominatory conventional wisdoms. These stem from two fields that are managerialistically biased and which share a common basis in a false rationality.","Info.

Smith H.J.; Keil M.,The reluctance to report bad news on troubled software projects: A theoretical model,2003,Information Systems Journal,26,102,"By one recent account, only 26% of software development projects are completed on schedule, within budget, and with the promised functionality. The remaining 74% are troubled in some way: they are either cancelled before the development cycle is completed (28%) or are delivered late, over budget, and with reduced functionality (46%), In many cases, the most cost-effective solution would be to abort the troubled project early in the cycle, but senior managers are often unaware of the project's problems. Anecdotal evidence and at least one recent study suggest that losses are sometimes increased by the reluctance of organizational members to transmit negative information concerning a project and its status. Thus, although evidence of a failing course of action may exist in the lower ranks of an organization, this information sometimes fails to be communicated up the hierarchy or is substantially distorted in the process. The result is that decision-makers with the authority to change the direction of the project are unaware of its true status. By modelling this reluctance to transmit negative project status information and improving our understanding of the phenomenon, we believe that prescriptions can be developed eventually to reduce the losses from troubled development projects. In this theory development paper, we examine the reluctance to transmit negative information and develop a theoretical model that explains this phenomenon within a software project context. The model we develop draws on literature from the fields of organizational behaviour and communications, ethics, economics, information systems and psychology, and points the direction for future research.","Wake Forest University, Babcock Grad.

There are two segments of potential software users - ethical users who will not copy, and unethical users who would copy if the benefit outweighs the cost. In deciding on policy, the government must consider how the publisher adjusts price and detection to changes in the fine, tax, and subsidy. Our key welfare result is that increases in detection affect welfare more negatively than price cuts. We also show that the tax is welfare superior to the fine, and that a subsidy is optimal. Generally, government policies that focus on penalties alone will miss the social welfare optimum.","Department of Finance, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Keeling Road, Section 4, Taiwan; School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543, 3 Science Drive 2, Singapore",Enforcement; Pricing,Computer software; Costs; Law enforcement; Public policy; Sales; Strategic planning; Taxation; Welfare analysis; Copyrights,Research article,Article,Software,Societal,Global,Normative,Utilitarianism,Analytical modeling; simulation,Theoretical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Naturalism,Implicit

Then imagine yourself being left to fight for your rights alone, and eventually finding out that it would be very difficult to hold the plagiarist accountable for what he or she did. The recent decision by the Association of Information Systems to create a standing committee on member misconduct suggests that while this type of situation may sound outrageous, it is likely to become uncomfortably frequent in the information systems research community if proper measures are not taken by a community-backed organization. In this article, we discuss factors that can drive plagiarism, as well as potential measures to prevent it. Our goal is to discuss alternative ways in which plagiarism can be prevented and dealt with when it arises. We hope to start a debate that provides the basis on which broader mechanisms to deal with plagiarism can be established, which we envision as being associated with and complementary to the committee created by the Association for Information Systems.","Department of MIS, College of Business Administration, Texas A and M Intl.

This paper details the development and empirical validation of a model of software piracy by individuals in the workplace. The model was developed from the results of prior research into software piracy, and the reference disciplines of the theory of planned behavior, expected utility theory, and deterrence theory. A survey of 201 respondents was used to test the model. The results indicate that individual attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are significant precursors to the intention to illegally copy software. In addition, punishment severity, punishment certainty, and software cost have direct effects on the individual's attitude toward software piracy, whereas punishment certainty has a significant effect on perceived behavioral control. Consequently, strategies to reduce software piracy should focus on these factors. The results add to a growing stream of information systems research into illegal software copying behavior and have significant implications for organizations and industry groups aiming to reduce software piracy.","Department of MIS, College of Business and Economics, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, United States; Dept. of Business Administration, Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; Department of Information, School of Business and Management, Hong Kong Univ. of Sci./Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",Computer ethics; Deterrence theory; Expected utility theory; Software piracy; Theory of planned behavior,Computer crime; Computer software; Computers; Information science; Computer ethics; Management information systems,Research article,Article,Software,Organization,USA,Empirical descriptive,Deterrence theory,Survey; PLS,Theoretical; empirical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Subjectivism; Non-cognitivism,Implicit

To better understand piracy, we propose a model of ethical decision making that is an adaptation of the four-component model of morality. This model defines four internal processes that result in external moral behavior: recognition, judgment, intention, and behavior. We test our model with a sample of Information Systems students in Hong Kong who provided measures of self-reported behavior regarding levels of buying and using pirated software. Using partial least squares, we investigated the causal pathways of the model and the effects of age and gender. We find that use is determined by buying, buying is determined by intention, and inten tion is determined by judgment. Although respondents recognized software piracy as an infringement of intellectual property rights, this fact did not affect their judgment of the morality of the act. Significant differences are also found in the ethical decision-making process based on age but only limited differences based on gender. The implications of these results, including the development of a professional ethics program, are discussed.","Department of Management Information Systems, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV 89154-6034, United States",Age; Ethical decision making; Ethical scenarios; Ethics; Gender; Intellectual property rights; Moral reasoning; Morality; Software piracy,Computer crime; Intellectual property; Least squares approximations; Software engineering; Age; Ethical decision making; Ethical scenarios; Ethics; Gender; Intellectual property rights; Moral reasoning; Morality; Decision making,Research article,Article,Software,Individual,Hong Kong,Empirical descriptive,Rest; consequentialism; deontology,Survey; scenarios; PLS,Theoretical; empirical,Software,0,0,0,1,Cognitivism; Anti-realism; Naturalism,Implicit

Genres are socially constructed: they may consequently be socially more or less acceptable or contested. This paper focuses on the concept of communicative genre and addresses the issue of how meta-communication processes guided by discursive-ethical principles can promote a rational and legitimate definition, design and structuring of genres. Such a meta-communication process has not yet been thoroughly discussed in relation to the concept of genre as a means for structuring (organizational) communication. This paper claims to make the following contributions: firstly, it provides a wider spectrum of discursive concepts for critically reflecting on and discursive evaluation of the content and structures of genres and genre instances. Secondly, it demonstrates how different kinds of meta-communications (ex ante, in-action, and ex post) can be used to legitimate genres in a manner compatible with the discourse ethics. It illustrates the discourse-ethical viewpoint concerning the legitimacy of genre structuring processes and thus, also, the legitimacy of resultant norms and contents of communication, especially in global contexts. © 2006 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Laffey D.,The ultimate bluff: A case study of partygaming.com,2007,Journal of Information Technology,9,2,"June 2005 was to bring online gambling out of the shadows and into the spotlight. PartyGaming, a start-up formed in 1997, launched a flotation (Initial Public Offering) on the London Stock Exchange that valued the firm at 4.64 billion giving it a larger market capitalisation than British Airways. PartyGaming had become the dominant player in the booming online poker market with its PartyPoker brand having over 50 market share. However, this float - as with Internet gambling in general - was not without controversy. While PartyGaming had an online gambling license from the tax haven of Gibraltar, nearly 90 of its revenue came from the United States, where the authorities viewed Internet gambling as illegal and threatened legal action. The complex operations of this truly global firm with bases in London, India, Gibraltar and Canada, the background of its founder Ruth Parasol in Internet pornography and the handling of its flotation also raised concerns from an ethical perspective, with some commentators questioning whether the float should have been allowed at all. These concerns were then confirmed as US legislation to curb online gambling was passed in September 2006, leading to PartyGaming's exit from the US market and an immediate fall of 58 in the share price. This case study analyses the entrepreneurs behind PartyGaming, its growth, the challenges it has faced, the ethical issues it poses and its future prospects.

Costello G.J.; Donnellan B.,The diffusion of WOZ: Expanding the topology of IS innovations,2007,Journal of Information Technology,7,11,"The growth and diffusion of self-service technology (SST) over the last decade has resulted in an increasing number of business and government transactions being completed without human assistance. One innovation in this area, the speech-enabled business system, is characterised by complex implementations that bring together language-processing technologies, applications development, and end-user psychology. A resulting secondary innovation, the Wizard-of-OZ (WOZ) experiment is a valuable technique for simulating and building human-machine prototypes to ensure successful deployment of the completed service. The objective of the paper is to examine these innovations in relation to the changing business landscape; the technology and innovation literature, and the population of likely adopters. The review is carried out by placing the authors' former experience as practitioners within current theoretical research frameworks. The result is a number of suggestions relating to both IT technology research and IT innovation research. Firstly, it proposes the simplification and diffusion of the WOZ methodology to support the growth in demand for automated e-business transactions that is mindful of human and ethical challenges. Secondly, the paper argues that because SST and business extends the traditional boundaries of the customer service function, it now needs to be incorporated into Swanson's tri-core innovation typology.

We then examine the extent to which e-government reflects the principles she espoused.

We discuss the implications arising from this analysis, and explore the benefits that governments could achieve from adoption of a sociotechnical, participatory approach to e-government development. The crucial enabling role of capacity building is highlighted.

Dulipovici A.; Baskerville R.,Conflicts between privacy and property: The discourse in personal and organizational knowledge,2007,Journal of Strategic Information Systems,26,31,"The paper critically examines knowledge ownership when personal or organizational knowledge is transferred between individuals or between individuals and organizations. Employing a form of discourse analysis, we analyse the data from three complementary perspectives (international treaties and conventions on privacy and intellectual property, employment and merchant account contracts, and verdicts from knowledge-related legal cases) to unveil the conflicts between privacy and property rights. The results show a dialectical view where ownership shifts between the individual and the organization/community and therefore, the individual may or may not necessarily own what he knows. Privacy and property have been central issues in computational ethics for more than two decades. The use of information systems for strategic purposes offers new challenges for these established ethical concepts. Knowledge is not only a form of property governed by intellectual property law; it is also an individual attribute and, as part of the personality, it may be governed by privacy law. As a result, the dialectical view also shows that the ownership shift between the individual and the organization/community means that the organization may or may not necessarily own what it knows. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Stahl B.C.,The ethical nature of critical research in information systems,2008,Information Systems Journal,26,89,"Critical research in information systems is based on and inspired by ethics and morality. In order to support this proposition, this paper will suggest a way of classifying critical research that differs from definitions common IS research. According to the current definition, research is critical when it is motivated by the intention to change social realities and promote emancipation. Based on this critical intention, critical research is furthermore characterized by critical topics, critical theories, and critical methodologies. Using these criteria of critical research, the paper argues that critical research is ethical in nature. To support this view, the paper introduces the concepts of ethics and morality by analysing two traditions of moral philosophy, here called the 'German tradition' and the 'French tradition'. Using three examples of current critical research in information systems, the paper will show that ethics and morality strongly influence critical intention, topics and theories. Having thus established the ethical nature of critical research, the paper concludes by discussing the weaknesses of critical research from the point of view of ethics and morality. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility, De Montfort University, Leicester LE1 9BH, The Gateway, United Kingdom",Critical research; Ethics; Foucault; Habermas; Morality,,Research article,Article,IS discipline,Social,Global,Normative,Deontology; discourse ethics; French moralism,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical,Disciplinary,0,0,0,0,Cognitivism,Implicit
Son J.-Y.; Kim S.S.,Internet users' information privacy-protective responses: A Taxonomy and a nomological model,2008,MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems,26,484,"Although Internet users are expected to respond in various ways to privacy threats from online companies, little attention has been paid so far to the complex nature of how users respond to these threats. This paper has two specific goals in its effort to fill this gap in the literature. The first, so that these outcomes can be systematically investigated, is to develop a taxonomy of information privacy-protective responses (IPPR). This taxonomy consists of six types of behavioral responses - refusal, misrepresentation, removal, negative word-of-mouth, complaining directly to online companies, and complaining indirectly to third-party organizations - that are classified into three categories: information provision, private action, and public action. Our second goal is to develop a nomological model with several salient antecedents - concerns for information privacy, perceived justice, and societal benefits from complaining - of IPPR, and to show how the antecedents differentially affect the six types of IPPR. The nomological model is tested with data collected from 523 Internet users. The results indicate that some discernible patterns emerge in the relationships between the antecedents and the three groups of IPPR. These patterns enable researchers to better understand why a certain type of IPPR is similar to or distinct from other types of IPPR. Such an understanding could enable researchers to analyze a variety of behavioralresponses to information privacythreats in a fairly systematic manner.

Córdoba J.-R.,Critical reflection in planning information systems: A contribution from critical systems thinking,2009,Information Systems Journal,24,34,"This paper presents a methodological framework to support the process of information systems (IS) planning in organizations. It draws on the ideas of critical systems thinking (CST), a research perspective that encourages the analysis of stakeholders' understandings prior to the selection and implementation of planning methods. The framework emphasizes continuous identification of concerns from stakeholders, and facilitates critical reflection in the exploration of possibilities for improvement. Some of these possibilities might require the support of IS and communication technologies. To define the framework, two systems theories are used: boundary critique and autopoiesis. The first one enables critical reflection on values and assumptions about potential situations or marginalization.

With these theories, the framework enables people to reflect on issues of inclusion, exclusion and marginalization, and to participate in the design of plans for improvement. Ultimately, the definition of this framework suggests the importance of critical reflection about ethics to improve the practice of IS planning. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Centre for Systems Studies, Business School, University of Hull, Hull, HU6 7RX, Cottingham Road, United Kingdom",Autopoiesis; Boundary critique; Critical systems thinking; Ethics; Improvement; Information systems planning,,Research article,Article,IS implementation,Organization,Colombia,Normative,Critical systems ethics; Foucault,Interpretive case study,Theoretical,Education,0,0,0,0,Cognitivism; Anti-realism; Relativism,Implicit

We examined the applicability of Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of Cognitive Moral Development (CMD) in non-Western contexts by investigating the ethical values of IT professionals in Asia's two largest economies. Analysis of survey data from Japan (n=289) and China (n=290) indicates support for the basic six-stage model of CMD. The concept of abiding by universal laws and rules (termed stage 4 reasoning by Kohlberg) was widely accepted by IT professionals in both Japan and China, despite the Confucian cultural emphasis on personal relationships with particularistic obligations. However, differences between Japanese and Chinese IT professionals were found while, in direct contrast with the stage-wise theory of CMD, the respondents from Japan and especially China exhibited significant volatility, reasoning at different stages simultaneously.

Chatterjee S.; Sarker S.; Fuller M.A.,A deontological approach to designing ethical collaboration,2009,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,31,46,"A core focus of Collaboration Engineering (CE) research has been to design and deploy codified fundamental building blocks (artifacts) of collaboration, thus making it possible for practitioner groups to collaborate even without the help of a professional facilitator. Given the fundamentally social nature of collaboration, we believe that designing such fundamental blocks (artifacts) needs to include considerations of participants' ethical values. As such, we propose a conceptual schema for a fundamental artifact having ethical features derived from the deontological view of ethics. Based on the notions of design theory, valuesensitive design, and deontological ethics, this paper develops an object-oriented representation of an Ethical Collaboration class that can be instantiated into objects that, in turn, can serve as fundamental building blocks for ethical collaboration.

Chatterjee S.; Sarker S.; Fuller M.,Ethical information systems development: A baumanian postmodernist perspective,2009,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,28,46,"The paper offers a critique of traditional methodical approaches to Information Systems Development (ISD), arguing that a number of assumptions (for example, universality and rationality) underlying these approaches lead to incomplete ontological and epistemological considerations, and thereby contribute to IS failures in many cases. The paper proposes that ethical analysis undertaken in conjunction with traditional ISD approaches may be a way to address some of the limitations experienced during traditional ISD. Drawing upon ideas from postmodern ethics formulated by Zygmunt Bauman, the paper argues that increased focus on the moral responsibility of key ISD players (such as the team of analysts) may improve the ISD process. Finally, this paper suggests how, consistent with the postmodern stance, such moral responsibility can be implemented in the context of ISD.

Martinsons M.G.; Ma D.,Sub-cultural differences in information ethics across China: Focus on Chinese management generation gaps,2009,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,17,45,"We combined scenarios based on information ethics issues identified by Mason (privacy, accuracy, property, and access) with questions based on the stages of moral development proposed by Kohlberg to empirically test two theories rooted in sociology: generational subculture theory and life-cycle theory. Evidence from more than 1,100 managers across China strongly supports generational subculture theory by revealing significant differences in information ethics among the Republican, Revolutionary, and Reform generations. The generation gaps suggest that events such as the Cultural Revolution as well as the implementation of both the Open Door Policy and the One-Child Policy have shaped the information ethics of Chinese managers. We also discovered fundamental tensions between Western moral philosophies (based on rules, democracy, individual rights, and personal freedoms) and the traditions of Chinese culture (based on relationships, hierarchy, collective responsibilities, and social harmony). The ethical dimensions of the evolution from traditional China to modern China, and from particularistic trust to systemic trust, are discussed. Combined with previous Chinese management research by Martinsons, our study implies that it will be difficult to resolve data privacy and intellectual property issues. It also raises concerns about cross-cultural research such as GLOBE and Hofstede that rely on narrow demographic samples.

Because consumers are vulnerable in their dealings with businesses due to a lack of information about and an inability to control the subsequent use of their personal information, we argue that organizations have a moral responsibility to these individuals to avoid causing harm and to take reasonable precautions toward that end. We further argue that firms can enhance their privacy programs by moving beyond merely complying with laws and other regulations and creating a culture of integrity that combines a concern for the law with an emphasis on managerial responsibility for the firm's organizational privacy behaviors. We use two high-profile data breaches experienced by two U.S. companies, ChoicePoint and TJX, to illustrate our arguments for enhancing organizational level privacy programs based on ethical reasoning. In doing so, this paper contributes to the dearth of prior organizationallevel privacy research, which has largely overlooked ethical issues or the personal harms often caused by privacy violations.

There is a substantial literature on ethical issues surrounding computing and information technology in the contemporary world, but much of this work is not published nor widely cited in the mainstream IS literature. The purpose of this paper is to offer one contribution to an increased emphasis on ethics in the IS field. The distinctive contribution is a focus on Habermas's discourse ethics. After outlining some traditional theories of ethics and morality, the literature on IS and ethics is reviewed, and then the paper details the development of discourse ethics. Discourse ethics is different from other approaches to ethics as it is grounded in actual debates between those affected by decisions and proposals. Recognizing that the theory could be considered rather abstract, the paper discusses the need to pragmatize discourse ethics for the IS field through, for example, the use of existing techniques such as soft systems methodology. In addition, the practical potential of the theory is illustrated through a discussion of its application to specific IS topic areas including Web 2.0, open source software, the digital divide, and the UK biometric identity card scheme.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose a set of principles for the conduct of critical research in information systems. We examine the nature of the critical research perspective, clarify its significance, and review its major discourses, recognizing that its mission and methods cannot be captured by a fixed set of criteria once and for all, particularly as multiple approaches are still in the process of defining their identity. However, we suggest it is possible to formulate a set of principles capturing some of the commonalities of those approaches that have so far become most visible in the IS research literature. The usefulness of the principles is illustrated by analyzing three critical field studies in information systems. We hope that this paper will further reflection and debate on the important subject of grounding critical research methodology.","Department of Information Systems and Operations Management, University of Auckland Business School, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; School of Management, State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902-6000, United States",Critical perspective; Critical research; Ethics; Interpretive perspective; Research methods; Values,Information systems; Critical perspectives; Critical researches; Ethics; Interpretive perspective; Values; Information use,Research essay,Article,IS discipline,Disciplinary,Global,Normative,"Critical Theory (Habermas, Bourdieu, Foucault)",Interpretive conceptual analysis,Methodological,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,0,Constructivism; Cognitivism,Implicit
Berente N.; Gal U.; Hansen S.,Ethical implications of social stratification in information systems research,2011,Information Systems Journal,25,14,"When investigating the use of information systems within organizations, researchers inevitably make decisions relating to the classification, or 'stratification', of information technology users. Most commonly, users are stratified along functional boundaries or by their membership in various communities of practice. It is important to note, however, that any such method of social stratification necessarily focuses the attention of a researcher on certain issues while unavoidably downplaying or neglecting other concerns. Individuals whose interests, values or identification align with these neglected issues may be inadvertently marginalized by the research approach. This observation suggests a range of ethical concerns related to the methods of social stratification used by researchers. In this paper, we argue that the method by which information systems researchers stratify organizational actors in their research has significant ethical implications. We propose a framework that maps stratification strategies that researchers bring to their analyses using Weber's theory of stratification and the dimensions of class, status and party, in conjunction with his distinction between heterogeneous and homogenous forms of work. We offer illustrative theoretical lenses for each category in the framework and demonstrate how each lens favours certain issues and potentially neglects others. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","University of Georgia, Athens, GA, United States; Copenhagen Business School, Copenhagen, Denmark; Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, United States",Critical social theory; Information ethics; IT users; Social stratification,Classification (of information); Philosophical aspects; Research; Communities of Practice; Ethical concerns; Ethical implications; Information ethics; IT users; Research approach; Social stratification; Social theory; Information systems,Research article,Article,IS discipline,Disciplinary,Global,Normative,Critical theory; deontology; teleology,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,0,Anti-realism; Subjectivism; Relativism,Explicit
White Baker E.,Why situational method engineering is useful to information systems development,2011,Information Systems Journal,19,14,"Effective methods and methodologies for building information systems (IS) remain crucial to building successful IS. This paper investigates the use of situational method engineering for IS development (ISD) projects in a professional bureaucracy. This specialist organization methodology (SOM) is built starting with the philosophy of ISD moving through to flexible, amethodical implementation methods, a proposed instance of situational method engineering that is targeted towards professional bureaucracies. An in-depth philosophical discussion of the ontological, epistemological, research methodological and ethical underpinnings of SOM are outlined, in addition to its limitations, to develop the building blocks of a methodology to implement within a professional bureaucracy organization ISD scenario. Amethodical ISD will be introduced as the appropriate way to implement this developed methodology to build a successful IS. The contribution of this paper is to detail how to develop a philosophically consistent methodology for a specific organizational environment (in this case, using the specific organizational example of a professional bureaucracy) that, when combined with developers and tools, can create a method to be applied to build an IS that has a greater possibility of successful organizational adoption than an IS built using a method devised using more common IS method engineering approaches. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Department of Economics and Business, Virginia Military Institute, Lexington, VA, United States",Amethodical systems development; Information systems development; ISD approach; Philosophical foundations of ISD; Situational method engineering,Management information systems; Ontology; Philosophical aspects; Professional aspects; Information systems development; ISD approach; Philosophical foundations of ISD; Situational Method Engineering; Systems development; Information systems,Research article,Article,IS development,Organization; social,Global,Normative,None; social relativism,Conceptual anlaysis,Theoretical; methodological,Software,0,0,0,0,Relativism; Anti-realism,Explicit
Jeff Smith H.; Dinev T.; Xu H.,Information privacy research: An interdisciplinary review,2011,MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems,26,1699,"To date, many important threads of information privacy research have developed, but these threads have not been woven together into a cohesive fabric. This paper provides an interdisciplinary review of privacy-related research in order to enable a more cohesive treatment. With a sample of 320 privacy articles and 128 books and book sections, we classify previous literature in two ways: (1) using an ethics-based nomenclature of normative, purely descriptive, and empirically descriptive, and (2) based on their level of analysis: individual, group, organizational, and societal. Based upon our analyses via these two classification approaches, we identify three major areas in which previous research contributions reside: the conceptualization of information privacy, the relationship between information privacy and other constructs, and the contextual nature of these relationships. As we consider these major areas, we draw three overarching conclusions. First, there are many theoretical developments in the body of normative and purely descriptive studies that have not been addressed in empirical research on privacy. Rigorous studies that either trace processes associated with, or test implied assertions from, these value-laden arguments could add great value. Second, some of the levels of analysis have received less attention in certain contexts than have others in the research to date. Future empirical studies-both positivist and interpretive-could profitably be targeted to these under-researched levels of analysis. Third, positivist empirical studies will add the greatest value if they focus on antecedents to privacy concerns and on actual outcomes. In that light, we recommend that researchers be alert to an overarching macro model that we term APCO (Antecedents → Privacy Concerns → Outcomes).","Department of Decision Sciences and Management Information Systems, Farmer School of Business, Miami University, Oxford, OH 45056, United States; Department of Information Technology and Operations Management, College of Business, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL 33431, United States; College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, United States",Information privacy; Interdisciplinary; Multi-theory; Regulation; Society,Weaving; Information privacy; Interdisciplinary; Multi-theory; Regulation; Society; Classification (of information),Theory and review,Review,Privacy,Organization; social,Global,Empirical descriptive,None; deontology; stakeholder theory,Literature review,Theoretical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Underdetermined,Underdetermined
Chan R.Y.K.; Lai J.W.M.,Does ethical ideology affect software piracy attitude and behaviour An empirical investigation of computer users in China,2011,European Journal of Information Systems,14,35,"This study empirically examines Chinese computer users ethical ideology and its relationship to their software piracy attitude and behaviour. The investigation reveals several important findings. First, cluster analysis results show that Chinese computer users can be divided into four ethical ideology types (i.e., situationists, absolutists, subjectivists, and exceptionists) reasonably consistent with Forsyth's taxonomy. Second, when compared with situationists, absolutists, and exceptionists, subjectivists are found to have the least unfavourable attitude towards software piracy and are most frequently engaged in software piracy. Third, Chinese computer users ideological relativism exerts a stronger influence on their software piracy attitude and behaviour than does their ideological idealism. The findings suggest that the government, and authentic software developers and vendors should focus on subjectivists as their target audience of anti-software piracy communications. These policy makers and practitioners should also make concerted efforts to help subjectivists better realise how their software piracy act may damage parties proximate to themselves so as to lower the rate of software piracy. © 2011 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Stahl B.C.,"Morality, ethics, and reflection: A categorization of normative IS research",2012,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,20,87,"Moral views and perceptions, their ethical evaluation and justification, and practical concerns about how to incorporate them all play important roles in research and practice in the information systems discipline. This paper develops a model of normative issues ranging from moral intuition and explicit morality to ethical theory and meta-ethical reflection. After showing that this normative model is relevant to IS and that it allows an improved understanding of normative issues, the paper discusses these levels of normativity in the context of two of the most prominent normative topics in IS: Privacy and intellectual property. The paper then suggests that a more explicit understanding of the different aspects of normativity would benefit IS research. This would leverage the traditional empirical strengths of IS research and use them to develop research that is relevant beyond the boundaries of the discipline. Such broader relevance could be aimed at the reference disciplines. In particular, moral philosophy could benefit from understanding information technology and its role in organizations in more detail. It could, furthermore, inform policy makers who are increasingly called on to regulate new information technologies.","De Montfort University, United Kingdom",Ethics; Intellectual Property; Morality; Normativity; Norms; Privacy,Information systems; Information use; Philosophical aspects; Ethical theories; Information systems disciplines; Moral philosophy; Morality; Norm; Normative models; Normativity; Policy makers; Privacy; Reference discipline; Intellectual property,Research article,Article,IS ethics,Disciplinary,Global,Normative,Deontology; consequentialism; virtue ethics; care ethics,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical,Research,1,0,0,1,Cognitivism,Explicit

In these evolving social spaces, the boundaries between actual and virtual reality, between living individuals and their virtual bodies, and between private and public domains are becoming ever more blurred. As a result, users and their presentations of self, as expressed through virtual bodies, are increasingly entangled. Consequently, more and more Internet users are cyborgs. For this reason, the ethical guidelines necessary for Internet research need to be revisited. We contend that the IS community has paid insufficient attention to the ethics of Internet research. To this end, we develop an understanding of issues related to online human subjects research by distinguishing between a disembodied and an entangled view of the Internet.

Walsham G.,Are we making a better world with ICTs? Reflections on a future agenda for the IS field,2012,Journal of Information Technology,6,281,"Dramatic changes in context have occurred over the last 25 years for those of us working in the information systems (IS) field, with ICTs becoming pervasive in many areas of human activity and in all countries of the world. It is ironic that the success of ICTs has led to concerns that the distinct research contribution of the IS field could become lost and that the field itself may decline. The literature over the last decade or so has offered different and sometimes opposing suggestions as to how the field should respond to these concerns. In this paper, I discuss these debates and I use the discussion as a basis for putting forward a skeleton future agenda for the IS field as a whole.

Lee A.S.; Baskerville R.L.,Conceptualizing generalizability: New contributions and a reply,2012,MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems,12,79,"Tsang and Williams offer some good and provocative ideas in their critique of our earlier article on generalizing and generalizability. In this essay we will advance some new ideas by building on those collected in both Tsang and Williams and our original article (Lee and Baskerville 2003). Because IS is a pluralist scientific discipline, one in which both qualitative and quantitative (and both interpretive and positivist) research approaches are valued, ""generalize"" is unlikely to be a viable term or concept if only one IS research paradigm may lay claim to it and excludes others from using it. Both papers agree on this point, but approach the problem differently. Where we originally generalized generalizability by offering new language, Tsang and Williams conceptualize generalizability by framing it more closely to its older, more statistically oriented form. We agree about the importance of induction and about the classification or taxonomy of different types of induction. We build further in this essay, advancing the ethical questions raised by generalization: A formulation of judgment calls that need to be made when generalizing a theory to a new setting.

Elbanna A.; Newman M.,The rise and decline of the ETHICS methodology of systems implementation: Lessons for IS research,2013,Journal of Information Technology,12,13,"Professor Mumford has contributed significantly to the information system (IS) field. Among her achievements and pioneering thinking is the development of an integrated methodology for systems implementation named Effective Technical and Human Implementation of Computer Systems (ETHICS) that incorporates job design as part of the systems planning and implementation effort. This study questions why ETHICS initially rose in popularity and then declined over the years. To answer this question, we apply Latour's (1999) five-loop framework to describe the formation of science. The findings reveal that Mumford held and aligned many heterogeneous actors and resources that together contributed to the shaping of ETHICS. As the content of ETHICS was shaped by the intertwining of many elements, when some of these elements later changed and undermined their previous alignment, the content of ETHICS was not reshaped, and hence it lost its status and declined.

The research aim in this study is to better understand diversity in IS research, and the extent to which the diversity of discourse expanded and contracted from 1995 to 2011. Methodologically, we apply a combined citations/co-citations analysis based on the eight Association for Information Systems basket journals and the 22 subject-field classification framework provided by the Association of Business Schools. Our findings suggest that IS is in a state of continuous interaction and competition with other disciplines. General Management was reduced from a dominant position as a reference discipline in IS at the expense of a growing variety of other discourses including Business Strategy, Marketing, and Ethics and Governance, among others. Over time, IS as a field moved from the periphery to a central position during its discursive formation. This supports the notion of IS as a fluid discipline dynamically embracing a diverse range of adjacent reference disciplines, while keeping a degree of continuing interaction with them.

Hansen J.; Walden E.,The role of restrictiveness of use in determining ethical and legal awareness of unauthorized file sharing,2013,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,28,20,"A host of different types of information goods are available for free download from illegal file sharing sites. As far as price is concerned, no company can compete against ""free."" Hence, managers, researchers, and policy makers are interested in determining factors other than price that might influence consumers' file sharing behavior. Moral consideration is one factor that might sway individuals to pay for files they could otherwise obtain for free. To help better understand how moral consideration works in the context of file sharing, this research examines how people form perceptions of the legality and ethicalness of downloading music files through file sharing. We propose that when people receive files in a more restrictive manner (e.g. streaming vs. downloading) they are less likely to recognize file sharing as being unethical or illegal. We conduct five studies to test our theory of restrictiveness. The results consistently indicate that consumers' perceptions of legality and ethicalness of file sharing are associated with restrictiveness of use. In particular, while file sharing with different levels of restrictiveness still transfers intellectual property from one individual to another, increased restrictiveness results in consumers being less likely to identify file sharing as being illegal or unethical. This in turn has a great impact on their actual engagement in the unauthorized file sharing activities.

Although extant literature explains why individuals in IT would act unethically in many situations, we know surprisingly little about what causes them to do so during the creative act of programming. To address this issue, we look at the reuse of Internet-accessible code: software source code legally available for gratis download from the Internet. Specifically, we scrutinize the reasons why individuals would unethically reuse such code by not checking or purposefully violating its accompanying license obligations, thus risking harm for their employer. By integrating teleological and deontological ethical judgments into a theory of planned behavior model - using elements of expected utility, deterrence, and ethical work climate theory - we construct an original theoretical framework to capture individuals' decision-making process leading to the unethical reuse of Internet-accessible code. We test this framework with a unique survey of 869 professional software developers. Our findings advance the theoretical and practical understanding of ethical behavior in information systems. We show that programmers use consequentialist ethical judgments when carrying out creative tasks and that ethical work climates influence programmers indirectly through their peers' judgment of what is appropriate behavior. For practice, where code reuse promises substantial efficiency and quality gains, our results highlight that firms can prevent unethical code reuse by informing developers of its negative consequences, building a work climate that fosters compliance with laws and professional codes, and making sure that excessive time pressure is avoided.

For point four, we review how McKenney et al. (1997) and Porra et al. (2005, 2006) applied Mason et al.’s (1997ab) seven steps of doing IS history.

Li H.; Sarathy R.; Zhang J.; Luo X.,"Exploring the effects of organizational justice, personal ethics and sanction on internet use policy compliance",2014,Information Systems Journal,23,122,"Internet security risks, the leading security threats confronting today's organizations, often result from employees' non-compliance with the internet use policy (IUP). Extant studies on compliance with security policies have largely ignored the impact of intrinsic motivation on employees' compliance intention. This paper proposes a theoretical model that integrates an intrinsic self-regulatory approach with an extrinsic sanction-based command-and-control approach to examine employees' IUP compliance intention. The self-regulatory approach centers on the effect of organizational justice and personal ethical objections against internet abuses. The results of this study suggest that the self-regulatory approach is more effective than the sanction-based command-and-control approach. Based on the self-regulatory approach, organizational justice not only influences IUP compliance intention directly but also indirectly through fostering ethical objections against internet abuses.

Results from a survey of 539 employee users suggest that SRS engenders an emotion-focused coping response in the form of moral disengagement from ISP violations, which in turn increases one's susceptibility to this behavior. Our multidimensional view of SRS - comprised of security-related overload, complexity, and uncertainty - offers a new perspective on the workplace environment factors that foster noncompliant user behavior and inspire cognitive rationalizations of such behavior. The study extends technostress research to the information systems security domain and provides a theoretical framework for the influence of SRS on user behavior. For practitioners, the results highlight the incidence of SRS in organizations and suggest potential mechanisms to counter the stressful effects of information security requirements. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","University of Delaware, United States; Brock University, United States; Saint Louis University, United States",coping theory; ethical orientation; information security; moral disengagement theory; sanctions; security compliance; security policies; security policy violation; social cognitive theory; technostress; workplace stress,Behavioral research; Cryptography; Personnel; Security of data; Security systems; coping theory; moral disengagement theory; sanctions; Security compliance; Security policy; Social cognitive theory; Technostress; Workplace stress; Interactive computer systems,Research article,Article,IS security,Individual,USA,Empirical descriptive,Moral Disengagement Theory (Bandura); coping theory,Survey; SEM,Empirical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Subjectivism; Anti-realism,Implicit

In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework of Company Information Privacy Orientation that attempts to reconcile the differences between the organisation's information management objectives and its ethical and legal obligations to address customers' privacy. Control theory and justice theory are utilised to build an organisation-level framework that is composed of a firm's ethical obligation to its customers, its customer information management strategy and its assessment of the risks to its business created by legal demands to provide customer information privacy. The four different types of company privacy orientation profiles that emerge from this conceptual framework are then discussed, along with implications for future research. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Reid Here and Associates Wellington, ON, Canada; Management Information Systems, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada; Management and Information Systems, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, United States",Control agency theory; Information management; Organisational level privacy; Privacy conceptual framework; Privacy ethics; Privacy laws; Privacy orientation; Procedural justice,Control theory; Information management; Philosophical aspects; Risk assessment; Agency theory; Conceptual frameworks; Organisational level; Privacy law; Procedural justice; Sales,Research article,Article,Privacy,Organization,Global,Normative,Stakeholder theory; social contract theory,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Constructivism; Cognitivism,Implicit
Hutter K.; Füller J.; Hautz J.; Bilgram V.; Matzler K.,Machiavellianism or Morality: Which Behavior Pays off in Online Innovation Contests?,2015,Journal of Management Information Systems,31,56,"Prior research on user behavior in online innovation contests has mainly focused on factors that positively impact prosocial, collaborative behavior, which should ultimately lead to innovative outcomes. However, little is known about the effects of more negative personal characteristics that might result in more competitive, antisocial, and even unethical behavior. This paper considers Machiavellianism as one of the traits that constitute the ""dark triad of personality"" and explores the relationship between Machiavellianism and participants contribution behavior in online innovation contests. Specifically we investigate how Machiavellian characteristics influence individuals contribution intensity, communication, and interaction behavior within the contest community as well as the quality and kind of their contributions. This study relies on multisource individual-level data from a large innovation contest in the field of public transportation. We find that the three dimensions of Machiavellianism - distrust of others, amorality, and desire for status - have very distinct behavioral consequences in the context of online innovation contests. Specifically, the oppositional consequences of amoral manipulation and striving for status on the one hand and showing distrust of others on the other hand concerning contribution quantity and contribution quality are found. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of negative personality traits such as Machiavellianism as powerful predictors of behavior and of success within competitive innovation environments and leads to important managerial implications regarding the design and management of innovation contests.

These data are often processed by algorithms, which support (or drive) decisions (termed 'algorithmic decision-making' in this article). While the strategic value of these data (and subsequent analysis) for businesses is unquestionable, the implications for individuals and wider society are less clear. Therefore, in this Viewpoint article we aim to shed light on the tension between businesses - that increasingly profile customers and personalize products and services - and individuals, who, as McAfee and Brynjolfsson (2012, p. 5) suggest, are 'walking data generators' but are often unaware of how the data they produce are being used, and by whom and with what consequences. Issues associated with privacy, control and dependence arise, suggesting that social and ethical concerns related to the way business is strategically exploiting digitized technologies that increasingly support our everyday activities should be brought to the fore and thoughtfully discussed.

Chatterjee S.; Moody G.; Lowry P.B.; Chakraborty S.; Hardin A.,Strategic Relevance of Organizational Virtues Enabled by Information Technology in Organizational Innovation,2015,Journal of Management Information Systems,38,103,"The central theme of this paper is that information technology (IT) can serve to create ethical organizations endowed with virtuous characteristics, and that such ethical organizations can innovate better in todays dynamic market environment. Drawing on the notion of virtue ethics propounded by the Greek philosopher Aristotle, we theorize that core organizational IT affordances influence the development of organizational virtues, which in turn influence organizational improvisational capabilities and innovation. We propose the ""IT-virtues-innovation"" (IVI) model and test it using a cross-organizational survey of 250 employees from various organizations in the United States. Our findings largely support our proposal that IT affordances positively influence organizational virtues, which then influence organizational improvisational capabilities, thus improving organizational innovation. This paper contributes to the understanding of organizational innovation by articulating the strategic usefulness of IT-enabled organizational ethics, and it explains how IT-enabled ethical competence (virtues) influences strategic competence (improvisational capabilities and innovation).

While there is a growing body of work on this phenomenon, we notice several gaps, limitations, and inconsistencies in the literature. In order to further understand this complex phenomenon and reconcile past findings, we conduct an exploratory study to uncover the nomological network of key constructs salient to this phenomenon, and the nature of their interrelationships. Using a scenario-based study of young adult participants, and both linear and nonlinear analyses, we uncover key nuances of this phenomenon of unethical IT use. We find that unethical IT use is a complex phenomenon, often characterized by nonlinear and idiosyncratic relationships between the constructs that capture it. Overall, ethical beliefs held by the individuals, along with economic, social, and technological considerations are found to be relevant to this phenomenon. In terms of practical implications, these results suggest that multiple interventions at various levels may be required to combat this growing threat to IS security.

We explored this question through a longitudinal field study of an OC in the healthcare arena. We found that multiple kinds of value were produced and changed over time as different participants engaged with the OC and its evolving technology in various ways. To explain our findings, we theorize OC value as performed through the ongoing sociomaterial configuring of strategies, digital platforms, and stakeholder engagement. We develop a process perspective to explain these dynamics and identify multiple different kinds of value being created by an OC over time: financial, epistemic, ethical, service, reputational, and platform. Our research points to the importance of expanding the notion of OC users to encompass a broader understanding of stakeholders. It further suggests that creating OC value increasingly requires going beyond a dyadic relationship between the OC and the firm to encompassing a more complex relationship involving a wider ecosystem of stakeholders. © 2016 INFORMS.","Judge Business School, Cambridge University, Cambridge, CB2 1AG, United Kingdom; Warwick Business School, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, United Kingdom; Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02142, MA, United States",Computer-mediated communication and collaboration; Digital; Health IT; Online communities; Value,Social networking (online); Websites; Computer mediated communication; Digital; Health it; On-line communities; Value; Online systems,Research article,Article,Online communities,Organization; social,UK,Empirical descriptive,None,Interpretive case study,Theoretical,Healthcare,0,0,0,0,Relativism; Anti-realism,Implicit

Drawing on value sensitive design (VSD), we explore microtask CS as perceived by crowd workers, revealing their values as a means of informing the design of CS platforms. Analyzing detailed narratives of 210 crowd workers participating in Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we uncover a set of nine values they share: access, autonomy, fairness, transparency, communication, security, accountability, making an impact, and dignity. We find that these values are implicated in four crowdsourcing structures: compensation, governance, technology, and microtask. Two contrasting perceptions-empowerment and marginalization-coexist, forming a duality of microtask CS. The study contributes to the CS and VSD literatures, heightens awareness of worker marginalization in microtask CS, and offers guidelines for improving CS practice. Specifically, we offer recommendations regarding the ethical use of crowd workers (including for academic research), and call for improving MTurk platform design for greater worker empowerment.","College of Business Administration and Public Policy, California State University, Dominguez Hills, 1000 E.

Markus M.L.,"Datification, Organizational Strategy, and IS Research: What's the Score?",2017,Journal of Strategic Information Systems,8,88,"This commentary on the JSIS Special Issue on datification focuses on two key themes selected from among the many topics discussed by Special Issue authors: 1) the debate over algorithmic intelligence versus human intelligence, and 2) the consequences of strategic performance systems. The current algorithmic versus human intelligence debate echoes earlier discussions in our field about whether expert systems should replace or support human experts. As appealing as it is to assume that algorithms support expert workers, research suggests that people are not very effective at monitoring and overriding automation. In addition, post-automation work tends to evolve toward lower human knowledge and skill. These observations should caution datification researchers against simplistic theories and should guide researchers to study the multilevel sociotechnical conditions and stakeholders involved in the design, use, and consequences of algorithms in organizations. Strategic performance measurement and ranking systems are also not new, but what is new is the belief that they will not just inform, but also transform, human behavior. In this respect, performance systems resemble the career tournaments that promote intense competition and create great inequality in executive pay and promotion. In addition, performance systems increasing serve as infrastructures, operating at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously. These observations imply that designing and studying such systems involve ethical choices, intensifying the demands on datification researchers. © 2017","Bentley University, United States",,Economic and social effects; Expert systems; Human behaviors; Human intelligence; Human knowledge; Multiple levels; Organizational strategy; Performance measurements; Performance system; Ranking system; Behavioral research,Commentary,Letter,Data ethics,Social; disciplinary,Global,Normative,None,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,quasi-Realism,Implicit
Prasopoulou E.,A half-moon on my skin: A memoir on life with an activity tracker,2017,European Journal of Information Systems,10,37,"Experiential computing shifts the focus of IS research on how humans encounter information technologies in everyday life. For this, it invites explorations on the role of the body and its affective propulsions as the locus of human experience. I argue, in this article, that this embodied perspective, studied through the lens of enchanted materialism (Bennett in The enchantment of modern life: attachments, crossings, and ethics. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2001), needs to be combined with an alternative writing genre to fruitfully explore life in experiential computing. It is for this reason that I present my research as a memoir on the use of wearables - an instantiation of the Internet of Things - in everyday life. The aim is to show that, when studying emerging technologies, an open-ended non-fictional genre like the memoir can produce astute and imaginative insights that may be as informative as traditional academic writing. The memoir produces a thick description of the way people interact with digital devices in experiential computing; their expectations and the subsequent effort to entangle the data in their daily lives. This way, it problematises current organising visions of a data-driven life.

The first goal of this study is to identify situational and personality factors that explain why certain individuals are susceptible to such attacks. The second goal is to test those empirically, along with previously identified factors, to explain the likelihood that an individual will fall victim to a phishing attack. We employed the Delphi method to identify seven personality factors that may influence this susceptibility (trust, distrust, curiosity, entertainment drive, boredom proneness, lack of focus, and risk propensity). Our regression model included these as well as variables examined in previous studies. We find that emails sent from a known source significantly increase user susceptibility to phishing, as does a user's curiosity, risk propensity, general Internet usage, and Internet anxiety.

The financial crisis with serious corporate and mutual fund scandals raised the profile of compliance as governmental bodies, institutional and private investors introduced a ‘tsunami’ of financial regulations. Adopting a multi-level analysis, this study examines how regulatory technology was used by financial firms to meet their compliance obligations, pre- and post-crisis. Empirical data collected over 12 years examine the deployment of an investment management system in eight financial firms. Interviews with public regulatory bodies, financial institutions and technology providers reveal a culture of compliance with increased transparency, surveillance and accountability. Findings show that dialectic tensions arise as the pursuit of transparency, surveillance and accountability in compliance mandates is simultaneously rationalized, facilitated and obscured by regulatory technology.

Because humans are hardwired to respond to faces in uniquely positive ways, artificial realistic faces hold great promise for advancing human interaction with machines. For example, realistic avatars will enable presentation of human actors in virtual collaboration settings with new levels of realism; artificial natural faces will allow the embodiment of cognitive agents, such as Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, putting us on a path to create “artificial human” entities in the near future. In this conceptual paper, we introduce natural face technology (NFT) and its potential for creating realistic visual presence (RVP), a sensation of presence in interaction with a digital actor, as if present with another human. We contribute a forward-looking research agenda to information systems (IS) research, comprising terminology, early conceptual work, concrete ideas for research projects, and a broad range of research questions for engaging with this emerging, transformative technology as it becomes available for application. By doing so, we respond to calls for “blue ocean research” that explores unchartered territory and makes a novel technology accessible to IS early in its application. We outline promising areas of application and foreshadow philosophical, ethical, and conceptual questions for IS research pertaining to the more speculative phenomena of “living with artificial humans.”. © 2018 by the Association for Information Systems.","University of Sydney, Australia",Avatars; Cognitive Agents; Realistic Faces; Uncanny Valley; User Interfaces; Virtual Presence; Virtual Reality,Ethical technology; Virtual reality; Avatar; Avatars and agents; Cognitive agents; Human actor; Human faces; Humaninteraction; Information system research; Realistic face; Uncanny valley; Virtual presence; User interfaces,Research paper,Article,Human-AI interaction,Individual; social,Global,Normative,None,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,0,Anti-realism,Implicit

However, research focused specifically on “the future” has yet to gain a strong foothold within the scholarly IS field. In this essay, we suggest a philosophical foundation and epistemological basis for futures-oriented research to advance such scholarship in the IS field. We first highlight epistemic assumptions about futures-oriented research drawn from the discourse of futures studies. We then draw on Feenberg’s philosophy of “potentiality and actuality” of technology as a foundation to consider how knowledge generated through IS research about the sociotechnical past and present might inform futures-oriented inquiry.

Digital goods producers and government entities argue that there are victims of piracy, whereas pirates may perceive their actions to be victimless. Regarding implications of our research, we extend the theory of planned behavior (TPB) by theorizing that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control could influence perceptions of moral obligations as a consequence of the desire to rationalize unethical behavior. Unlike prior literature, we manipulate the rationalization of moral obligations due to the victimless view toward piracy and show how moral obligations become important determinants of piracy behavior. Accordingly, our demonstrated malleability of morals may be an important path through which individuals are able to continue past behaviors. We also conduct a second study to identify the effect of implementing an educational message from a fictitious software company to exogenously nudge the pirate and influence the impact of perceived moral obligations on intentions to pirate. Our results show that the introduction of an exogenous educational message is an effective piracy mitigation strategy. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Eller College of Management, University of Arizona, United States; Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, United States; Ohio State University, United States",Digital piracy; information ethics; morals; norms; piracy mitigation; software piracy; theory of planned behavior; victimless crime,Knowledge management; Digital piracy; Information ethics; morals; norms; piracy mitigation; Theory of Planned Behavior; Computer crime,Research article,Article,Piracy,Individual,USA,Empirical descriptive,Theory of planned behavior,Experiment; survey; scenarios,Empirical,Digital goods,0,0,0,0,Subjectivism; Anti-realism; Non-cognitivism,Implicit

However, IS research largely focuses on: (1) episteme, explanatory and predictive theories; and (2) techné, theories of action for implementation and management of IS technologies. Consequently, we lack applicable knowledge for deliberating about IS value conflicts. The third type of knowledge, phronesis, which Aristotle proposed to inform ethical application of episteme and techné, has not been given much attention in our discipline. Presently, we are experiencing a critical limitation in our capabilities for generating ethically applicable IS knowledge in the face of increasing value conflicts arising from pervasive digitalisation. In this paper, we introduce phronesis, discuss its philosophical foundations and illustrate an approach to phronetic enquiry into the underlying value conflicts of a failed national IS infrastructure project.

Benjamin V.; Valacich J.S.; Chen H.,"DICE-E: A framework for conducting Darknet identification, collection, evaluation with ethics",2019,MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems,21,63,"Society's growing dependence on computers and information technologies has been matched by an escalation of the frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks committed by criminals operating from the Darknet. As a result, security researchers have taken an interest in scrutinizing the Darknet and other underground web communities to develop a better understanding of cybercriminals and emerging threats. However, many scholars lack the capability or expertise to operationalize Darknet research and are thus unable to contribute to this increasingly impactful body of literature. This article introduces a framework for guiding such research, called Darknet Identification, Collection, Evaluation, with Ethics (DICE-E). The DICE-E framework provides a focused reference point and detailed guidelines for scholars wishing to become active in the Darknet research stream. Four steps to conducting Darknet forum research are outlined: (1) identification of Darknet data sources, (2) data collection strategies, (3) evaluation of Darknet data, and (4) ethical concerns related to Darknet research. To illustrate how DICE-E can be utilized, an example empirical study is reported. This exemplar illustrates how DICE-E can guide scholars through key decision points when attempting to incorporate the Darknet within their research. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

Sarker S.; Chatterjee S.; Xiao X.; Elbanna A.,The sociotechnical axis of cohesion for the IS discipline: Its historical legacy and its continued relevance,2019,MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems,24,488,"The sociotechnical perspective is often seen as one of the foundational viewpoints—or an “axis of cohesion”—for the Information Systems (IS) discipline, contributing to both its distinctiveness and its ability to coherently expand its boundaries. However, our review of papers in the two leading IS journals from 2000 to 2016 suggests that IS research has lost sight of the discipline’s sociotechnical character—a character that was widely acknowledged at the discipline’s inception. This is a problem because an axis of cohesion can be fundamental to a discipline’s long-term vitality. In order to address this issue, we offer ways to renew the sociotechnical perspective so that it can continue to serve as a distinctive and coherent foundation for the discipline. Our hope is that the renewed sociotechnical frame for the IS discipline discussed in the paper holds potential to contribute to the enduring strength of our diverse, distinctive, yet unified discipline.

These novel consumer-to-consumer marketplaces have started to obliterate the boundaries between private and economic spheres. Marketing personal resources online is inherently associated with the disclosure of personal and sometimes intimate information. This raises unprecedented questions of privacy. Yet, there is so far little research on the role of privacy considerations in the sharing economy literature. Leveraging the theoretical perspective of privacy calculus, we address this gap by investigating how privacy concerns and economic prospects shape a potential provider’s intentions to share via different communication channels. We relate privacy concerns back to the provider’s perceptions of the audience. We evaluate our research model by means of a scenario-based online survey, providing broad support for our reasoning. © 2019, Association for Information Systems.

Some have criticized crowdsourcing for worker exploitation and for undermining workplace regulations. Others have lauded crowdsourcing for enabling workers' autonomy and allowing disadvantaged people to access previously unreachable job markets. In this paper, we examine the ethics in crowdsourcing practices by focusing on three questions: (a) What ethical issues exist in crowdsourcing practices? (b) are ethical norms emerging or are issues emerging that require ethical norms? and, more generally, (c) how can the ethics of crowdsourcing practices be established? We answer these questions by engaging with Jürgen Habermas' discourse ethics theory to interpret findings from a longitudinal field study (from 2013 to 2016) involving key crowdsourcing participants (workers, platform organizers, and requesters) of three crowdsourcing communities. Grounded in this empirical study, we identify ethical concerns and discuss the ones for which ethical norms have emerged as well as others which remain unresolved and problematic in crowdsourcing practices. Furthermore, we provide normative considerations of how ethical concerns can be identified, discussed, and resolved based on the principles of discourse ethics. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Discipline of Business Information Systems, The University of Sydney Business School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; School of Information Systems and Technology Management, UNSW Business School, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia; School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom; School of Social Sciences, The University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS, Australia",critical theory; crowdsourcing; discourse ethics; fairness; freelancing; Habermas,Crowdsourcing; critical theory; discourse ethics; fairness; freelancing; Habermas; Philosophical aspects,Special issue paper,Article,Online communities,Group; organization,Western,Empirical descriptive,Discourse ethics,Field study; interviews; thematic analysis,Theoretical; empirical,Crowdsourcing,0,0,0,0,Constructivism,Explicit

Having been drawn on the social information processing theory, this research develops an integrative model that investigates how ethical work climate, beliefs, and neutralization interact to jointly explain ISP noncompliance. The model is tested via a survey of a broad cross section of employees. Neutralization, perceived cost of compliance, and perceived cost of noncompliance are found to significantly impact ISP noncompliance. Egoistic, benevolent, and principled climates are found to differentially influence neutralization and individuals' cognitive beliefs about the cost and benefit of ISP compliance versus noncompliance.

We draw on the field of critical social theory to introduce the “Logics,” a new framework to the IS discipline that reveals a performative relationship between collective framing, power, and affect. The Logics enable us to study buy-in by revealing the differing degrees of affective self-identification that underpin and color social practices, showing their inherently political nature. We exemplify the affective as well as social politics of buy-in with an account of Unity 3D, a market-leading game engine that underwent a major repositioning from “fringe” to “mainstream” markets, and discuss four poles of affective positioning with which to conceptualize technology buy-in. We conclude by highlighting the consequent need for greater political and ethical awareness about the framing of IS and by proposing a framework for conceptualizing actors’ orientations toward and thus possible buy-in or resistance to technology framing. © 2020 by the Association for Information Systems.","University of Münster, Germany; University of Warwick, United Kingdom; University of Exeter, United Kingdom",Affective Politics; Discourse; Game Engine; Group Dynamics; Technology Buy-In; Technology Framing,Affective politic; Discourse; Game Engine; Group dynamics; Power; Social politics; Social practices; Social theory; Technology buy-in; Technology framing; Commerce,Review and Theory Development,Review,IS implementation,Group; organization,Global,Normative,Post-structuralist ethics; critical ethics,Ethnography; discourse analysis,Theoretical,Game development,0,0,0,0,Non-cognitivism; Anti-realism; Subjectivism; Relativism,Implicit

Previous studies have mainly explored the effects of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches on employee ISP compliance. However, how social influence at both individual and organizational levels impacts the effectiveness of these two approaches has not been adequately explored. This study proposes a social contingency model in which a rules-oriented ethical climate (employee perception of a rules-adherence environment) at the organizational level and susceptibility to interpersonal influence (employees observing common practices via peer interactions) at the individual level interact with both command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches to affect ISP compliance.

Trying to exploit the strategic business potential embedded in big data, many organizations have started to renovate their business models or develop new ones, giving rise to the phenomenon of big-data business models. Although big-data business model research is still in its infancy, a significant number of studies on the topic have been published since 2014. We thus suggest it is time to perform a critical review and assessment of the literature at the intersection of business models and big data (analytics), thereby responding to recent calls for further research on and sustained analysis of big-data business models. In particular, our review uses three major criteria (big-data business model types, dimensions, and deployment) to assess the state of the big-data business model literature and identify shortcomings in this literature. On this basis, we derive and discuss five central research perspectives (supply chain, stakeholder, ethics, national, and process), providing guidance for future research and theory development in the area.

With this article we make two main contributions. First, we identify key choices associated with the design, implementation and use in practice of ADMS in organizations, that build on past literature and are tied to timely industry-related examples.

Marabelli M.; Vaast E.; Li J.L.,Preventing the digital scars of COVID-19,2021,European Journal of Information Systems,16,56,"In this commentary, we consider the ambivalent role of ubiquitous computing during the COVID pandemic and we point to the risk that some negative, IT-related practices associated with the pandemic will endure after it. We call these lasting effects the digital scars of COVID-19. The same IT that has positive impacts for some people might have negative impacts for others–often vulnerable populations, minorities and socio-economically disadvantaged groups. Some issues stem from the longstanding digital divide that characterises modern societies. Yet, the pandemic is exacerbating these inequalities. We are worried that some debatable uses of technology will persist after the pandemic is over. We therefore point to the prominent role of the IS community in enabling positive aspects of IT use during and after the pandemic, while mitigating negative aspects, especially in the long run. Our sociotechnical background enables us to see these dynamics in a processual and holistic way. To shed light on these issues, we analyse three key technologies widely used to deal with COVID (social software, AI/ML and robotics) and identify critical topics and associated research questions where IS scholarship should focus its attention to generate novel theorising and impactful practical insights. © Operational Research Society 2020.","Information and Process Management Department, Bentley University, Waltham, United States; Information Systems, Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, Montreal, Canada","COVID-19; digital scars; discriminations; ethical implications; IS theorising; Pär Ågerfalk, Kieran Conboy and Michael Myers; sociotechnical systems",Digital divide; Disadvantaged groups; Key technologies; Research questions; Social software; Sociotechnical; Ubiquitous computing,Issues and opinions,Opinion,Healthcare,Social,Global,Normative,Deontology; consequentialism,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Naturalism; particularism; non-cognitivist,Implicit
Trinkle B.S.; Warkentin M.; Malimage K.; Raddatz N.,High-risk deviant decisions: Does neutralization still play a role?,2021,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,29,16,"Extant research has shown that neutralization processes can enable potential IS security policy violators to justify their behavior and overcome the deterrence effect of sanctions in order to engage in unethical behaviors. However, such sanctions are typically moderate and not career ending. We test the boundary conditions of this theory by evaluating whether neutralization plays a role in overcoming the impact of extreme levels of deterrence. We extend the Siponen and Vance (2010) framework within a professional context that assigns extreme sanctions to violators. Using the scenario-based factorial survey method common in IS security research, we collected data from future auditors who understand these extreme sanctions. We test the reasons that auditors may use to form intentions to falsify information concerning an information security issue with a company’s accounting information system, thereby jeopardizing data integrity and security by modifying working papers to hide irregularities and, by doing so, violating their professional standards, which could result in career-ending sanctions. We empirically validated and tested the theoretical model. Our results show that sanctions play an important role in reducing employees’ intentions to violate policy but that, even under extreme boundary conditions, employees might seek to rationalize their unethical behavior by denying responsibility for their actions through, for example, arguing that their supervisors pressured them into performing the violations. We also establish that messages heightening the awareness and perceptions of the certainty and severity of organizational punishment are likely to attenuate such deviant behaviors. We discuss the implications of these findings and suggest future avenues for research. © 2021 by the Association for Information Systems.","Mississippi State University, United States; Florida Gulf Coast University, United States; University of Memphis, United States",Boundary Conditions; Compliance; Deterrence Theory; Ethics; Neutralization; Security; Theory Contextualization,Boundary conditions; Security of data; Accounting Information Systems; Data integrity; Information concerning; IS security policies; Neutralization process; Professional standards; Security research; Theoretical modeling; Personnel,Research article,Article,IS security,Individual,USA,Empirical descriptive,Deterrence theory; neutralization theory,Experiment; survey,Empirical,Accounting,0,0,0,1,Non-cognitivism; Anti-realism; Subjectivism,Implicit

The overemphasis of digital inclusion as a solution to the digital divide problem frames Internet use as desirable in a progressive society but labels non-use as problematic or a deficiency that needs to be remedied. This situation, we argue, creates a new modality of inequality that we term digital enforcement, defined as the process of dispossession that reduces choices for individuals who prefer to minimise their reliance on the Internet if given the opportunity or those who want to live their lives offline altogether. We present digital enforcement as an ethical problem and draw on the concepts of governmentality and technologies of power to explain how practices around Internet use in society result in digital enforcement. We conclude with a hopeful perspective to call for an ethical agenda to develop desirable futures. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Business Information Systems, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand",democratisation of technology; digital enforcement; digital inclusion; governmentality; social inclusion; technologies of power,Information systems; Digital divide; Digital inclusion; Ethical problems; Governmentality; Internet technology; Internet use; New modality; Problem Frames; Philosophical aspects,Research opinion,Article,Privacy,Social,New Zealand,Normative,Deontology; consequentialism,Conceptual analysis; vignettes,Theoretical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Realism; Cognitivism,Implicit
Davison R.M.; Martinsons M.G.; Wong L.H.M.,The ethics of action research participation,2022,Information Systems Journal,21,14,"Action research (AR) involves one or more researchers and a client organisation. Many guidelines for and reports of the research method have been published. However, the ethical issues associated with AR have been largely neglected. Our review of the AR literature found that ethical dilemmas and their resolution are rarely and inconsistently reported. Stimulated by this neglect and our personal experiences, we aim to raise awareness and understanding about the ethics of planning, conducting and reporting AR. We identify and discuss four issues of concern that merit specific ethical attention when conducting AR: collaboration, competence, persistence and consent. We draw on these four issues in an analysis that augments the principles and criteria for canonical AR (CAR), recently reified as Integrated Action Research (IAR). Our guidance includes an additional principle of AR and 10 associated criteria to address the ethics of AR participation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Department of Information Systems, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong; Department of Management, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong; NUCB Business School, Nagoya University of Commerce & Business, Japan",action research; ethics; research collaboration; research consent; research method; research principles,Information systems; Action research; Ethical dilemma; Ethical issues; Personal experience; Principles and criterion; research methods; Philosophical aspects,Research opinion,Article,IS discipline,Disciplinary,Global,Normative,Deontology; consequentlialism; virtue ethics,Conceptual analysis,Methodological,Research,0,0,0,1,Subjectivism; Relativism; Cognitivism,Implicit

Organisations increasingly rely on people analytics to optimise human resource management practices in areas such as recruitment, performance evaluation, personnel development, health and retention management. Recent progress in the field of AI and ever-increasing volumes of digital data have raised expectations and contributed to a very positive image of people analytics. However, transferring and applying the efficiency-driven logic of analytics to manage humans carries numerous risks, challenges, and ethical implications. Based on a theorising review our paper analyses perils that can emerge from the use of people analytics. By disclosing the underlying assumptions of people analytics and offering a perspective on current and future technological advancements, we identify six perils and discuss their implications for organisations and employees. Then, we illustrate how these perils may aggravate with increasing analytical power of people analytics, and we suggest directions for future research. Our theorising review contributes to information system research at the intersection of analytics, artificial intelligence, and human-algorithmic management. © 2021 The Author(s).

Kordzadeh N.; Ghasemaghaei M.,"Algorithmic bias: review, synthesis, and future research directions",2022,European Journal of Information Systems,21,353,"As firms are moving towards data-driven decision making, they are facing an emerging problem, namely, algorithmic bias. Accordingly, algorithmic systems can yield socially-biased outcomes, thereby compounding inequalities in the workplace and in society. This paper reviews, summarises, and synthesises the current literature related to algorithmic bias and makes recommendations for future information systems research. Our literature analysis shows that most studies have conceptually discussed the ethical, legal, and design implications of algorithmic bias, whereas only a limited number have empirically examined them. Moreover, the mechanisms through which technology-driven biases translate into decisions and behaviours have been largely overlooked. Based on the reviewed papers and drawing on theories such as the stimulus-organism-response theory and organisational justice theory, we identify and explicate eight important theoretical concepts and develop a research model depicting the relations between those concepts. The model proposes that algorithmic bias can affect fairness perceptions and technology-related behaviours such as machine-generated recommendation acceptance, algorithm appreciation, and system adoption. The model also proposes that contextual dimensions (i.e., individual, task, technology, organisational, and environmental) can influence the perceptual and behavioural manifestations of algorithmic bias. These propositions highlight the significant gap in the literature and provide a roadmap for future studies. © Operational Research Society 2021.","Foisie School of Business, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, United States; DeGroote School of Business, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada","ai ethics; algorithmic accountability; Algorithmic bias; algorithmic fairness; data analytics; Patrick Mikalef, Aleš Popovic, Jenny Eriksson Lundström and Kieran Conboy; responsible ai",Decision making; Environmental technology; Ethical technology; Ai ethic; Algorithmic accountability; Algorithmic bias; Algorithmic fairness; Algorithmics; Data analytics; Organisational; Responsible ai; Data Analytics,Literature review,Review,Ethical IS design,Organization; social,Global,Normative,Rawls; organizational justice,Literature review,Theoretical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Constructivism; Cognitivism; Naturalism,Implicit

The notion of AI comprises a wide-ranging set of technologies that allow individuals and organizations to integrate and analyze data and use that insight to improve or automate decision-making. While most attention has been placed on the positive aspects companies realize by the adoption by the adoption and use of AI, there is a growing concern around the negative and unintended consequences of such technologies. In this special issue we have made a call for research papers that help us explore the dark side of AI use. By adopting a dark side lens, we aimed to expand our understanding of how AI should be implemented in practice, and how to minimize or avoid negative outcomes. In this editorial, we build on the notion of responsible AI, to highlight the different ways in which AI can potentially produce unintended consequences, as well as to suggest alternative paths future IS research can follow to improve our knowledge about how to mitigate such occurrences.

Jimenez A.; Abbott P.; Dasuki S.,In-betweenness in ICT4D research: critically examining the role of the researcher,2022,European Journal of Information Systems,14,17,"The ICT4D discipline has faced criticisms of an uneven production of knowledge that reinforces a dichotomy between Global North-Western knowledge systems on the one side, and Global South-indigenous-Southern knowledge systems on the other. As a result, some ICT4D literature has examined the role of the researcher in reinforcing these biases and further exacerbating inequalities, thus highlighting the complex relationship between ICT4D researchers and the research process. Yet, most of this literature has focused on an insider/outsider researcher positionality. This paper explores the role of the researcher from the alternative position of in-betweenness, where researchers adopt more fluid and dynamic positions as reflexive spaces. To do this, we engage in a dialogical process of retrospective reflections based on ICT4D projects in Nigeria, Peru and West Africa. Through these cases, we identify how we experience in-betweenness in distinct ways: as liminal spaces, as performative spaces, and as spaces of disjuncture. We also examine how these forms of in-betweenness informed our research. We demonstrate that a researcher positionality of in-betweenness in ICT4D research can increase awareness of nuanced researcher roles and potentially avoid ethical dilemmas and reproducing biases. © 2021 The Author(s).

Gal U.; Hansen S.; Lee A.S.,Research Perspectives: Toward Theoretical Rigor in Ethical Analysis: The Case of Algorithmic Decision-Making Systems,2022,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,27,19,"Algorithmic decision-making systems (ADMS) are increasingly being used by public and private organizations to enact decisions traditionally made by human beings across a broad range of domains, including business, law enforcement, education, and healthcare. Their growing prevalence engenders profound ethical challenges, which, we maintain, should be examined in a structured and theoretically informed fashion. However, much of the ethical exploration of ADMS within the IS field draws upon an atheoretical application of ethics. In this paper, we argue that the “big three” ethical theories of consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics can inform a structured comparative analysis of the ethical significance of ADMS. We demonstrate the value of such an approach through an illustrative case study of an ADMS in use by an Australian bank. Building upon this analysis, we address four characteristics of ADMS from the three theoretical perspectives, provide guidance on the contexts within which the application of each theory might be particularly fruitful, and highlight the advantages of theoretically grounded ethical analyses of ADMS. © 2022, Association for Information Systems.

We first examine the metaverse's technologies and its underlying business models, which hold immense strategic implications for organizations and industries, and might require rethinking the future of work. As with most emerging technologies able to generate, collect, and process user data, the metaverse comes at a price; leveraging the metaverse strategically will require ethical and DEI considerations. After examining all these aspects of the metaverse, we reflect on ways IS scholarship engaged in strategizing can advance theoretical and practical knowledge by generating novel research questions and outlining a research agenda. Our contribution is twofold: first, we analyze the metaverse using a sociotechnical lens, thereby setting the ground for future studies of the phenomenon. Second, we identify specific strategic implications as well as DEI opportunities and challenges associated with the metaverse, and discuss how scholarship versed in IS strategizing can contribute to addressing them, both theoretically and empirically. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Bentley University, 175 Forest St., Waltham, 02122, MA, United States; Warwick Business School, Scarman Rd, Coventry, CV4 7AL, United Kingdom",DEI; Emerging technologies; Ethics; Interoperability; IS strategizing; Metaverse; Societal consequences; Sociotechnical systems,"Ethical technology; 3d experiences; Diversity, equity, and inclusion; Emerging technologies; Immersive; IS strategizing; Lay-out; Metaverses; Sensor device; Societal consequence; Sociotechnical systems; Interoperability",Viewpoint,Article,Ethical IS design,Organization; society,Global,Normative,None,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical; research agenda,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Constructivism,Implicit
Tomalin M.,Rethinking online friction in the information society,2023,Journal of Information Technology,13,5,"A recurrent mantra of the technology industry is that all forms of ‘friction’ should be eliminated from online interactions (especially commercial transactions). In this context, ‘friction’ refers to any unnecessary retardation of a process or activity that delays the user accomplishing a desired action. This broad category can therefore include online adverts that link to the wrong webpages, pop-up windows that block access to content or delays in the physical delivery of an ordered item. Although visions of a frictionless future have been common since at least 1995 (the year Bill Gates popularised the phrase ‘friction-free capitalism’), the basic notion has remained unhelpfully vague. Accordingly, this article focuses specifically on the phenomenon of online friction (i.e. ‘e-friction’) and elaborates a typology of the main subtypes. An analytical framework of this kind makes it much easier to compare and contrast distinct kinds of e-friction, recognising that important differences distinguish those that are ‘elective’, ‘non-elective’, ‘impeding’, ‘distracting’ and so on. Having sketched a preliminary typology, the article reflects upon the ethical implications of the distinct varieties, and concludes by suggesting that there are several reasons why an entirely (e-)frictionless future is a profoundly disturbing one. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2022.","University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom",friction; ICTs and society; information technology; online communications; social networking,Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Commercial transactions; Ethical implications; ICT and society; Information society; On-line communication; Online interaction; Pop-up windows; Social-networking; Technology industry; Web-page; Friction,Research article,Article,Social media,Social,Global,Normative,Floridi's information ethics,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical; conceptual model,Social media,0,0,0,0,Realism; Non-naturalism,Implicit

Lindman J.; Makinen J.; Kasanen E.,"Big Tech’s power, political corporate social responsibility and regulation",2023,Journal of Information Technology,15,28,"The economic dominance of large Internet tech companies, specifically the ‘Big Five’ (Google, Apple, Meta née Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft), is fundamentally complicating the organisation of society. Their positions raise profound questions, old and new, at the intersection of information systems and political philosophy, where companies have traditionally appeared in liberal democracies as economic operators rather than powerful political actors that threaten to limit citizens’ fundamental rights significantly through their operations. Importantly, the traditional understanding of corporate social responsibility is rooted in the liberal-democratic conception of moral labour’s division between public and private powers in a market economy. Focussing on this division, the paper analyses the various types of political power these companies wield and the complexities of regulating that power. Thus, it contributes to the IS discipline’s theoretical discussion by introducing political theory concepts that hold untapped potential for reconciling Big Tech and modern liberal-democratic conceptions of society. Taking these concepts as underpinnings for discussing six types of power, in turn (business vs. politics, democratic government, institutions of a market economy, companies, civil society and citizens), the paper offers the discipline example research questions to tackle and points to potential directions for scholarship. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2023.","Department of Applied IT, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Estonian Business School Tallinn, Tallinn, Estonia; Department of Management Studies, Aalto University School of Business, Espoo, Finland; Aalto University, Aalto, Finland",Big tech; corporate social responsibility (CSR); digitalization; ethics; fundamental rights; political theory,Economic and social effects; Social aspects; Big five; Big tech; Corporate social responsibility; Digitalization; Fundamental right; Market economies; Political theory; Power; Social regulations; Commerce,Research article,Article,Digitalization,Social,USA; EU,Normative,Rawlsian liberalism,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical,Technology,0,0,0,1,Realism; Cognitivism; Constructivism,Implicit
Nussbaumer A.; Pope A.; Neville K.,A framework for applying ethics-by-design to decision support systems for emergency management,2023,Information Systems Journal,21,22,"The development and utilisation of new information and communication technologies presents opportunities and risks, which bring ethical issues to the forefront. Any attempt to minimise the potential negative consequences to individuals, organisations and society resulting from the use of these technologies is challenging. In order to address these challenges, this paper presents an ethics-by-design approach that has been developed and implemented in the context of Decision Supports Systems for Emergency Management. Such systems help manage large and cross-border disasters by supporting decision makers to respond on emergencies in a reasonable way by taking follow-up actions into account. The approach taken in this paper specifically provides means to support the ethical dimensions of these decisions. Actions taken during disasters can have ramifications that persist long after a disaster has passed. The ethics-by-design approach presented here not only informs the design of systems, but also considers the role and training of the decision makers in the design process. The paper builds on the literature on ethics in information systems and makes a contribution to theory by providing a framework to ensure ethical considerations are embedded into the design of systems. © 2021 The Authors.

However, the roles that people play and the activities they perform have changed considerably over time. People now engage with digital technologies for all kinds of activities and in all kinds of ways, including for both personal and professional purposes. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to reconceptualize the term “user.” We discuss the various activities that people engage in with digital technologies, the myriad roles they play, and an essential shift in what the term “user” means. Users might be active in shaping how a particular information system is used, they might be partners with an information system, they might be used by an information system, and they may spend sizable parts of their lives living essentially within information systems.

Feng N.; Zhou T.; Feng H.; Li M.,Optimal Launch Timing of Bug Bounty Programs for Software Products under Different Licensing Models,2024,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,27,0,"An increasing number of software firms are utilizing bug bounty programs (BBPs) to detect bugs and enhance their product quality by leveraging the contributions of external ethical hackers. Although launching a BBP involves bounties as well as the costs of processing bug reports and fixing bugs, software firms can save failure costs and enjoy the benefits of greater user trust. The costs and benefits resulting from launching a BBP vary with launch timings and software licensing models. Hence, we investigate the optimal BBP launch strategies for software firms, using perpetual or subscription licensing models. Our findings reveal that under perpetual licensing, the firm has only two viable launch strategies: simultaneous launch, i.e., launching the software and the BBP simultaneously, and no launch. Under subscription licensing, however, delayed launch, i.e., launching the BBP later than the software release time, occurs as the optimal strategy when the failure cost is not high and the benefit of user trust is significant. Two distinct patterns in the relationship between the firm’s bug-fixing capability and its payoff are identified: a U-shaped pattern and an inverted U-shaped pattern. We uncover the conditions under which a firm should opt not to launch a BBP as its bug-fixing capability improves. This study offers insights into how firms can be motivated to launch BBPs to improve the overall reliability of their software. © 2024 by the Association for Information Systems.","College of Management and Economics, Laboratory of Computation and Analytics of Complex Management Systems(CACMS), Tianjin University, China; College of Management and Economics, Tianjin University, China",Bug Bounty Program; Ethical Hacker; Launch Timing; Software Licensing Model,Launching; Personal computing; Philosophical aspects; Program debugging; Software reliability; Bug bounty program; Bug-fixing; Ethical hacker; Failure cost; Launch timing; Shaped pattern; Software firms; Software licensing; Software licensing model; U-shaped; Timing circuits,Research article,Article,Software,Organization,Global,Empirical descriptive,None,Analytical modeling,Theoretical,Software,0,0,0,0,Underdetermined,Underdetermined

In this paper, using a design archaeology approach, we analyzed the historical, stakeholder, artifactual, aesthetic, instrumental, and symbolic dimensions of COVIDSafe—a contact tracing IS implemented by the Australian Government. Based on the findings, we embarked on design theorizing, moving from the specific instance of the COVID-19 pandemic and COVIDSafe to the broader problem of VUCA health situations and solutions (i.e., infectious disease management information systems [IDMIS]). We contribute a new design theory for IDMIS specifying the aims and scope of the future design efforts for which the design theory can be useful, the roles of different stakeholders, and a set of design principles that clearly define actors, contexts, mechanisms, and rationale. We also discuss the usability of our inductively developed theory. Normatively, we add to the descriptive and explanatory knowledge that promotes a greater understanding of the role of IS in controlling and managing infectious diseases.

Lee J.; Yoo C.W.; Wang J.; Rao H.R.,Use of Body Worn Camera (BWC) In Gray Scenarios: a Law Enforcement Officers’ Perspective,2024,European Journal of Information Systems,19,0,"Body Worn Camera (BWC) is an Information Technology (IT) artefact that has begun to be used in law enforcement. In this paper, we develop a research model that focuses on law enforcement agents’ perspective about the ethical use of BWC, by extending rational choice theory (RCT) from the standpoint of cost/benefit of using BWC, contextual factors, as well as organisational justice. The paper tests the relationship between three factors: a) work motivation, b) cost of using BWC, and c) benefit of using BWC and police perceptions of ethical use of BWC. In addition, we test the moderating effects of work-related uncertainty on the above three relationships. The associations between organisational justice factors and work motivation are also discussed. Further, in collaboration with the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), we develop three grey BWC scenarios that are not clearly ethical nor clearly unethical. We apply a survey methodology to test the model in the context of grey scenarios. The results show that work motivation and the risk of using BWC are negatively related with the law enforcement agents’ perceptions about ethical use of BWC and these relationships are negatively moderated by work-related uncertainty, while justice constructs are positively associated with perceived work motivation. © The Operational Research Society 2023.","Department of Computer Information Systems, Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, LA, United States; Department of Information Technology and Operations Management, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, United States; Department of Information Systems and Operations Management, University of Texas, Arlington, TX, United States; Department of Information Systems and Cyber Security, University of Texas, San Antonio, TX, United States",Body worn camera; emerging technology; perceptions about ethical use of IT artefact,Ethical technology; Law enforcement; Motivation; Risk perception; Body worn camera; Cost/benefit; Emerging technologies; Law enforcement officers; Organisational; Perception about ethical use of information technology artifact; Rational choice theory; Research models; Uncertainty; Work-related; Cameras,Research article,Article,Security,Individual; organization,USA,Empirical descriptive,Rational choice theory,Survey; scenarios; PLS SEM,Empirical,Law enforcement,0,0,0,1,Cognitivism,Implicit
Saffarizadeh K.; Keil M.; Maruping L.,Relationship Between Trust in the Artificial Intelligence Creator and Trust in Artificial Intelligence Systems: The Crucial Role of Artificial Intelligence Alignment and Steerability,2024,Journal of Management Information Systems,36,7,"This paper offers a novel perspective on trust in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, focusing on the transfer of user trust in AI creators to trust in AI systems. Using the agentic information systems (IS) framework, we investigate the role of AI alignment and steerability in trust transference. Through four randomized experiments, we probe three key alignment-related attributes of AI systems: creator-based steerability, user-based steerability, and autonomy. Results indicate that creator-based steerability amplifies trust transference from AI creator to AI system, while user-based steerability and autonomy diminish it. Our findings suggest that AI alignment efforts should consider the entity with which the AI goals and values should be aligned and highlight the need for research to theorize from a triadic view encompassing the user, the AI system, and its creator. Given the diversity in individual goals and values, we recommend that developers move beyond the prevailing “one-size-fits-all” alignment strategy. Our findings contribute to trust transference theory by highlighting the boundary conditions under which trust transference breaks down or holds in the emerging human-AI environment.

Mettler T.; Stepanovic S.,Acceptable nudge strategies to incentivize the use of wearables and physiolytics at work: A Q-methodology examination,2024,Journal of Information Technology,26,4,"The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the pressure on organizations to ensure health and safety in the workplace. An increasing number of organizations are considering wearables and physiolytics devices as part of their safe return to work programs so as to comply with governments’ accountability rules. As with other technologies with ambivalent use (i.e., simultaneously beneficial and harmful), the introduction of these devices in work settings is met with skepticism. In this context, nudging strategies as a way of using design, information, and other ways to manipulate behaviors (system 1 nudge) and choices (system 2 nudge) has gained traction and is often applied alongside the introduction of ambivalent technologies with the aim to “nudge” their use. While the feasibility of different nudge strategies is often studied from only a managerial perspective, where employees’ volitional autonomy and dignity is often treated as secondary, we explore which nudges are acceptable from the perspectives of ordinary workers. Using Q-methodology as a more evolutionary and participatory way to design nudges, we describe five basic strategies that are (to varying degrees) acceptable to them: (a) positive reinforcement and fun, (b) controlling the organizational environment, (c) self-responsibility, (d) collective responsibility, and (e) adapting the individual environment. Our findings show that there is a wide range of viewpoints on what is being considered an acceptable nudge and stress the importance of a transparent, equal dialogue between those who design nudges and potential nudgees. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2023.","Swiss Graduate School of Public Administration, University of Lausanne, Chavannes-près-Renens, Switzerland",Connected devices; health monitoring; IS ethics; nudging; physiolytics; Q-methodology; surveillance; wearables,Wearable technology; Connected device; Health and safety; Health monitoring; IS ethic; Nudging; Physiolytic; Q-methodology; Surveillance; Wearables; Work programs; Human resource management,Research article,Article,Healthcare,Group; individual,Switzerland,Empirical descriptive,None,Q-metholodology; interpretivist,Empirical,Healthcare,0,0,0,0,Subjectivism; Cognitivism; Relativism,Implicit
Alavi M.; Leidner D.E.; Mousavi R.,Knowledge Management Perspective of Generative Artificial Intelligence,2024,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,11,53,"In this editorial, revisiting Alavi and Leidner (2001) as a conceptual lens, we consider the organizational implications of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) from a knowledge management (KM) perspective. We examine how GenAI impact the processes of knowledge creation, storage, transfer, and application, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges this technology presents. In knowledge creation, GenAI enhances information? processing and cognitive functions, fostering individual and organizational learning. However, it also introduces risks like AI bias and reduced human socialization, potentially marginalizing junior knowledge workers. For knowledge storage and retrieval, GenAI’s ability to quickly access vast knowledge bases significantly changes employee interactions with KM systems. This raises questions about balancing human-derived tacit knowledge with AI-generated explicit knowledge. The paper also explores GenAI’s role in knowledge transfer, particularly in training and cultivating a learning culture. Challenges include an over-reliance on AI and risks in disseminating sensitive information. In terms of knowledge application, GenAI is seen as a tool to boost productivity and innovation, but issues like knowledge misapplication, intellectual property, and ethical considerations are critical. Conclusively, the paper argues for a balanced approach to integrating GenAI into KM processes. It advocates for harmonizing GenAI’s capabilities with human insights to effectively manage knowledge in contemporary organizations, ensuring both technological advances and ethical responsibility. © 2024 by the Association for Information Systems.","Scheller College of Business, Georgia Institute of Technology, United States; McIntire School of Commerce, University of Virginia, United States",AI-Driven Innovation; Ethical Implications of AI; GenAI Integration in Organizations; Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI); Knowledge Management; Knowledge Workers; Organizational Learning,,Editorial,Editorial,Knowledge manangement,Organization,Global,Normative,None,Conceptual analysis,Conceptual,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Underdetermined,Underdetermined

Kankanhalli A.,Peer Review in the Age of Generative AI,2024,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,8,19,"Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), including recent generative forms, are significantly impacting our lives and work. A key aspect of our work as IS researchers is the publishing of research articles, for which peer review serves as the primary means of quality control. While there have been debates about whether and to what extent AI can replace researchers in various domains, including IS, we lack an in-depth understanding of how AI can impact the peer review process. Considering the high volume of submissions and limited reviewer resources, there is a pressing need to use AI to augment the review process. At the same time, advances in AI have been accompanied by concerns about biases introduced by AI tools and the ethics of using them, among other issues such as hallucinations. Thus, critical issues to understand are: how can AI augment and potentially automate the review process, what are the pitfalls in doing so, and what er the implications for IS research and peer review practice. I will offer my views on these issues in this opinion piece. © 2024 by the Association for Information Systems.","Department of Information Systems and Analytics, National University of Singapore, Singapore",Artificial Intelligence (AI); Augment; Bias; Ethics; Generative AI; Hallucinations; IS Research; Peer Review Process,,Editorial,Editorial,IS discipline,Disciplinary,Global,Normative,None,Conceptual analysis,Conceptual; methodological,Research,0,0,0,1,Anti-realism,Implicit
Michels L.; Ochmann J.; Schmitt K.; Laumer S.; Tiefenbeck V.,"Salience, transparency, and self-nudging: a digital nudge to promote healthier food product choices",2024,European Journal of Information Systems,30,7,"Information Systems (IS) research has proposed digital nudges as a promising toolset for supporting consumers in making better decisions. However, there is a vivid academic debate regarding the ethical underpinnings of nudging and potential measures to alleviate ethical concerns. One particularly promising approach to digital nudging is leveraging salience effects. Yet, the potential of digital salience nudges remains underexplored in IS literature, and little is known about how measures proposed to alleviate ethical concerns affect their behavioural impact. In a preregistered online experiment (N = 600), we assess the effects of a digital salience nudge on the healthiness of food product choices. Additionally, we examine how two proposed ethical measures, namely transparency and self-nudging, influence the nudge’s effects. We find that implementing the digital salience nudge in an online supermarket decreased the proportion of unhealthy food products chosen by 63% and increased the proportion of healthy alternatives by 30%. Notably, disclosing transparent information about the nudge did not impact its effectiveness. Offering the nudge as a self-nudge led to comparable effects to a preset nudge when combined with transparent information. We conclude that digital salience nudging is effective and that nudges can be ethically designed without compromising their behavioural impact. © The Operational Research Society 2023.","Institute of Information Systems, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Nürnberg, Germany",digital nudging; ecommerce; ethics; salience; self-nudging; transparency,Nutrition; Philosophical aspects; Digital nudging; Ecommerce; Ethical concerns; Healthy foods; Information system research; On-line experiments; Product choice; Salience; Self-nudging; Toolsets; Transparency,Research article,Article,E-commerce,Individual,UK,Empirical descriptive,Behavioral economics,Experiment,Empirical,E-commerce,0,0,0,0,Naturalism,Implicit
Ebrahimi S.; Abdelhalim E.; Hassanein K.; Head M.,Reducing the incidence of biased algorithmic decisions through feature importance transparency: an empirical study,2024,European Journal of Information Systems,,2,"As firms move towards data-driven decision-making using algorithmic systems, concerns are raised regarding the lack of transparency of these systems which could have ramifications related to users’ trust and the potential for provoking discriminatory decisions. Although previous research has developed methods to improve algorithmic transparency, little empirical evidence exists regarding the extent of the effectiveness of these approaches. Drawing upon Rest’s theory of ethical decision-making and the literature on algorithmic transparency and bias, we investigate the effectiveness of feature importance (FI), a common transparency-enhancing approach, which illustrates the nature and the weights of the features utilised by an algorithm. Through an online experiment employing a fictitious tool that provided recommendations for selecting employees for a promotion-related training programme, we find that FI is effective when biased recommendations include direct discrimination (i.e. when individuals are treated less favourably on protected grounds such as gender); but is of little assistance when discrimination is indirect (i.e. when a criterion or practice that is apparently neutral, disadvantages a group of individuals who are of a protected class). Additionally, we propose a new transparency approach, using aggregated demographic information, to accompany FI in indirect discrimination circumstances and report the results of testing its effects. © 2024 The Author(s).

Ciriello R.; Gal U.; Hannon O.; Thatcher J.,Responsible social media use: how user characteristics shape the actualisation of ambiguous affordances,2024,European Journal of Information Systems,,3,"Social media’s dual role as a source of both societal benefits and harms poses significant challenges to its responsible use. While existing literature primarily focuses on organisational and regulatory responsibilities, it sometimes overlooks individual user responsibility. This paper develops a theoretical framework that suggests user characteristics–specifically, conscientiousness and moral tolerance–are key moderators in the responsible (or irresponsible) actualisation of social media’s ambiguous affordances. Grounded in virtue ethics, the framework maintains that four archetypal user characters–narcissist, dogmatist, nihilist, and altruist–shape how social media affordances are actualised. Our work contributes to the Information Systems (IS) literature by adding a nuanced understanding of how responsible use shapes and is shaped by social media users and the sociotechnical context. The framework offers a basis for future research to examine the interaction between user characteristics, affordance ambiguity, and responsible social media use, underscoring the need for technocentric and sociocentric design interventions to promote responsible use. © 2024 The Author(s).

Nyman S.; Bødker M.; Blegind Jensen T.,Reforming work patterns or negotiating workloads? Exploring alternative pathways for digital productivity assistants through a problematization lens,2024,Journal of Information Technology,17,12,"Digital trace data can be used to capture organizational practices in granular detail and enable the automation of a wide range of managerial tasks. One example is Digital Productivity Assistants (DPA) that harness digital trace data about knowledge workers’ performance and make targeted suggestions for how to improve and optimize their work patterns. Previous research shows that despite benevolent intentions to increase workers’ wellbeing, DPA tend to introduce novel forms of exploitation and control. Inspired by Michel Foucault’s philosophical strategy of ‘problematization,’ which emphasizes how practices are constructed in the form of problems that subsequently shape certain solutions, this paper takes a critical yet constructive view of DPA. Specifically, we conduct a genealogical reading of the DPA tool, Microsoft MyAnalytics, to investigate the problematics that have structured its emergence, as well as how its uses imply certain discursive commitments to philosophical and ethical questions. In the prevailing discourse, DPA cast digital trace data as a learning opportunity and thereby commit to individualizing the responsibility for handling the paradoxical nature of increasingly fluid work arrangements. Conversely, in our account of the history of MyAnalytics, we uncover a ‘lost discourse’ committed to trace data as a resource that can help knowledge workers negotiate excessive workloads. We propose the problematization lens as a way critically to articulate alternatives and speculate about instantiations of digital technology that today seem ‘unthinkable’. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2023.","Department of Digitalization, Copenhagen Business School, Frederiksberg, Denmark",algorithmic management; critical IS; Digital productivity assistants; Foucault; management of knowledge work; problematization lens,Knowledge management; Algorithmic management; Algorithmics; Critical IS; Digital productivity assistant; Foucault; Knowledge work; Management of knowledge work; Problematization lens; Trace data; Work patterns; Philosophical aspects,Research article,Article,Human-AI interaction,Organization,USA,Normative,Post-structuralist (Foucault),Foucauldian genealogy,Conceptual,Human resources,0,0,0,0,Anti-realism; Constructivism,Explicit

Hovorka D.S.; Mueller B.,Speculative foresight: A foray beyond digital transformation,2025,Information Systems Journal,22,4,"As the discourse regarding digital transformation has developed, we see an opportunity to extend the concept of becoming digital into an as-of-yet unrealized future. By examining the foundational assumptions of digital transformation, we reveal two frontiers that expand the current transformation discourse into futures where their implications and outcomes will reside. A conceptual frontier suggests that we begin to conceptualise the worlds in which future organisations and people observe digital technologies and their enactments as an unexceptional and quite mundane aspect of their daily lives. We initiate conceptualising being digital as an outcome of the transformations our current research studies. A second analytic frontier embraces world-making in current theorizations and the development of future-leaning conceptualization of alternative worlds. Speculative foresight is an approach for staging new concepts and relationships, critiquing current research practice and theory boundaries, and creating novel and generative theorizations. An example speculative foresight scenario illustrates onto-epistemic assumptions and ambiguities in current theories of digital transformation regarding how future ethics will be conceived. The implications and limitations of this approach are discussed in the context of the need for IS research to develop orientations that can contribute to understanding digital transformation processes and both positive and negative transformation outcomes that will constitute yet unrealized futures. © 2024 The Authors.

Previous research predominantly focused on the capabilities and limitations of Gen.AI to establish guidelines for research practices. However, the rapid evolution of Gen.AI often outpaces the publication of methodological papers. In response, our study adopts a criteria-centric approach, scrutinizing the scientific quality standards that Gen.AI must meet. In other words, instead of discussing what Gen.AI can and cannot do, we discuss what we should allow Gen.AI to do, irrespective of its capabilities. Our study informs researchers in the art and science of SLRs. First, we analyze the established state-of-the-art processes and associated quality standards in SLRs. From this, we synthesize a unified process and criterion set, not only underpinning a comprehensive understanding of the extant SLR methodologies but also serving as the foundational framework for integrating Gen.AI. Second, we delineate the specific scenarios conducive to incorporating Gen.AI into this fundamental framework, as well as situations where its integration may not be suitable.

Dey D.; Lahiri A.; Mukherjee R.,Polarization or Bias: Take Your Click on Social Media Polarization or Bias: Take Your Click on Social Media ,2025,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,28,0,"A major policy concern emerging in recent years is whether social media platforms, driven completely by profit motivations, create divisions within society and inject bias into their user base. A related question is: How should a policymaker intervene if these allegations prove to be true? In this study, we set up a microeconomic model to study whether a platform’s profit motivation may indeed compel it to adopt a user-targeting strategy that injects bias and creates polarization. We then examined how a policymaker might intervene and whether there are unintended consequences of such interventions. In doing so, we discovered an interesting duality between polarization and bias-both can add to the platform’s coffers but might act as substitutes in its profit function. If policymakers try to crack down on polarization, it could end up making the platform switch to bias instead. Finally, we examined the role of public awareness in moderating the platform’s desire for profit. Our results provide broad insights into a platform’s incentives and contribute to the public debate on this issue. © 2025, Author.

Tingelhoff F.; Marga J.J.,Avoiding virtual dystopia: A design theory for emancipatory participatory immersive platforms,2025,Journal of Strategic Information Systems,,0,"Immersive platforms, accessed via VR and AR interfaces, offer a profound digital experience but raise significant privacy and ethical concerns. Current systems collect extensive user data; this enables manipulative advertising and behavior control, fosters self-censorship, and diminishes authentic self-expression – especially among marginalized communities. The unchecked development of immersive platforms threatens to create oppressive environments due to power imbalances and a lack of regulation. This paper addresses the urgent need for emancipatory design guidelines to prevent such outcomes. By integrating critical theory with Participatory Design, we propose Emancipatory Participatory Immersive Platforms. These platforms involve users in their design and dismantle oppressive structures through four emancipatory tools (i.e., agency, dialogue, inclusion, and rationality), substantiated by eight actionable design principles. Our framework aims to empower users, promote inclusivity, and ensure rational engagement – and thereby foster immersive platforms that maintain functional benefits while enhancing freedom and equity. © 2025 The Author(s)","Information Systems, University of Osnabrück, Germany; Institute of Information Systems and Digital Business, University of St, Gallen, Switzerland; Chair of Organizational Behavior, WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management, Deutschland, Düsseldorf, Germany",Critical Theory; Design Science; Diversity Equity Inclusion (DEI); Emancipation; Immersive Platforms; Participatory Design,Critical theory; Design science; Design theory; Diversity equity inclusion; Emancipation; Ethical concerns; Immersive; Immersive platform; Participatory design; Privacy concerns,Research article,Article,Human–AI interaction;  Immersive platforms,Social; organization,None,Normative,Critical theory ,Critical interpretive analysis,Theoretical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,0,Anti-realism; Cognitivism,Implicit

While significant research from fields such as machine learning and human–computer interaction (HCI) has advanced our understanding of algorithmic fairness, less is known about how managers in organisational contexts perceive and respond to unfair algorithmic recommendations, particularly in terms of individual-level distributive fairness. This study focuses on job promotions to uncover how algorithmic unfairness impacts managers' perceived fairness and their subsequent acceptance of DA recommendations. Through an experimental study, we find that (1) algorithmic unfairness (against women) in promotion recommendations reduces managers' perceived distributive fairness, influencing their acceptance of these recommendations; (2) managers' trust in DA competency moderates the relationship between perceived fairness and DA recommendation acceptance; and (3) managers' moral identity moderates the impact of algorithmic unfairness on perceived fairness. These insights contribute to the existing literature by elucidating how perceived distributive fairness plays a critical role in managers' acceptance of unfair algorithmic outputs in job promotion contexts, highlighting the importance of trust and moral identity in these processes. © 2024 The Author(s).

Pieper M.; Gleasure R.,How AI Helps to Compile Human Intelligence: An Empirical Study of Emerging Augmented Intelligence for Medical Image Scanning,2025,Information Systems Journal,,0,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing continuously. However, full delegation to an AI application is often not possible or desirable due to technical limitations, ethical concerns or legal issues. Augmented intelligence systems, where humans and AI work together jointly, have been proposed to improve decision making in complex, uncertain and failure-intolerant environments. Yet, this raises questions about how compatible human and AI knowledge are, and whether translating between the two increases decision making intelligence, or whether it effectively limits AI applications' capacity for computational agency and human agents' capacity to consider uniquely human knowledge. We explore this notion by looking at augmented intelligence in terms of systemic intelligence and mutual learning. Building on an emergence perspective, we perform a case study of an augmented intelligence system for image-based diagnostics in the radiology branch of a medical care centre. Our findings indicate a strong distinction between specialists' and non-specialists' intelligence augmentation with AI. This distinction fuels generative cycles which produce iteratively more sophisticated algorithms, human representations and practical routines. Drawing on this analysis, we propose three stages by which new forms of intelligence emerge from the addition of AI recommendation tools, specifically, intelligence by propagation, intelligence by specialisation and intelligence by articulation. © 2025 The Author(s).

Abbott P.Y.; Dasuki S.; Jimenez A.,The 4Rs: A collective reflexive methodology for realising critical self-transformation in ICT4D research practice,2025,Information Systems Journal,51,2,"The “critical turn” in information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) research emphasises a transformative and ethical research practice which can be addressed by developing the critical intent and agency of ICT4D researchers through reflexive practice. There exist, however, limited methodological insights into existing reflexive approaches and a limited understanding of how self-transformation and change can take place through more critically reflexive ICT4D research practice. To address these issues, this paper proposes a reflexive methodology for ICT4D research, labelled “the 4Rs”, which comprises four interrelated reflective and potentially self-transforming processes of Retrospection, Representation, Review and Reinterpretation. We present the explanations and justifications of the methodology in detail with illustrative examples. We also employ a metacognitive process to understand how self-transformation can be realised through the use of this methodology and demonstrate the applicability of the 4Rs for other ICT4D researchers. Our main contribution lies in illustrating how this collective and critical approach can be used to deepen the self-reflexivity of traditional individual confessional accounts. We also demonstrate how the approach can lead to new collective knowledge and contribute to achieving more critical agency. © 2024 The Author(s).

Herath Pathirannehelage S.; Shrestha Y.R.; von Krogh G.,Design principles for artificial intelligence-augmented decision making: An action design research study,2025,European Journal of Information Systems,22,6,"Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have proliferated, garnering significant interest among information systems (IS) scholars. AI-powered analytics, promising effective and low-cost decision augmentation, has become a ubiquitous aspect of contemporary organisations. Unlike traditional decision support systems (DSS) designed to support decisionmakers with fixed decision rules and models that often generate stable outcomes and rely on human agentic primacy, AI systems learn, adapt, and act autonomously, demanding recognition of IS agency within AI-augmented decision making (AIADM) systems. Given this fundamental shift in DSS; its influence on autonomy, responsibility, and accountability in decision making within organisations; the increasing regulatory and ethical concerns about AI use; and the corresponding risks of stochastic outputs, the extrapolation of prescriptive design knowledge from conventional DSS to AIADM is problematic. Hence, novel design principles incorporating contextual idiosyncrasies and practice-based domain knowledge are needed to overcome unprecedented challenges when adopting AIADM. To this end, we conduct an action design research (ADR) study within an e-commerce company specialising in producing and selling clothing. We develop an AIADM system to support marketing, consumer engagement, and product design decisions. Our work contributes to theory and practice with a set of actionable design principles to guide AIADM system design and deployment. © 2024 The Author(s).

This paper reports insights from the journey of one organisation—Johnson & Johnson—that developed an employee skills inference platform based on artificial intelligence with the objective of creating a digital-first workforce capable of thriving amid the new reality of continuous digital innovation. We describe the challenges J&J faced during the deployment of the platform and the activities they undertook in response to these challenges. Based on that, we identify three organisational practices critical for the successful deployment of AI: blueprinting the future workforce, managing ethical data work across borders, and compensating for AI blind spots. From Johnson & Johnson's experience, we derive several important lessons for other organisations interested in using AI to develop a digital-first workforce. © 2025 The Author(s).

To address this challenge, we propose EDGE, a novel ethical design method that focuses on two key activities in the systems development process—ethical grounding and evaluation of ethical impacts. We provide an empirical example of the EDGE method by applying it to the redesign of a sustainable application in the energy industry. This empirical example reveals the need for ethical clarity to ground and evaluate the app to achieve improved ethical performance and social impacts. We conclude with the implications of the new ethical design method and future research directions for its application and enhancement. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2024.","University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, United States; University of North Carolina, Greensboro, NC, United States; Middle Tennessee State University, Murfreesboro, TN, United States; University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, United States",critical deconstruction and reconstruction; emancipation; Ethical design; ethical grounding and evaluation; green energy; next-generation design method; social good; values,Critical deconstruction and reconstruction; Design method; Emancipation; Ethical designs; Ethical grounding and evaluation; Green energy; Next-generation design method; Social good; Social impact; Value; Green development,Research article,Article,Human-AI interaction; Ethical IS design,Organization; social,Germany,Normative,Critical theory ,Design science,Artifact; theoretical,Energy,0,0,1,0,Cognitivism; Realism,Implicit
Marabelli M.; Davison R.M.,Artificial intelligence and the environment: ethical challenges and strategic opportunities for organizations,2025,Journal of Strategic Information Systems,,0,"In this viewpoint article, our goal is to raise awareness and spark debate in the Information Systems (IS) community regarding a prominent concern that has important strategic and ethical implications: the environmental impact of the increasing use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). We examine several specific issues, beginning with GAI's heavy consumption of natural resources and electricity. We then move to assessing how the rich and the Global North gain via GAI, while the poor and the Global South must deal with its adverse effects. We then move to assessing GAI's impact on underrepresented communities and countries in the Global South; while GAI contributes to global warming, this affects people unevenly, because it is mostly rich people and the Global North that make intensive use of these technologies. After suggesting that more local and global laws are needed to regulate the sustainable use of AI, we report on how organizations can perform AI strategizing, for instance to control emissions in smart cities and improve weather forecasting. We conclude with a research agenda that aims to encourage IS scholars to focus on the environmental impact of AI, its ethical implications for organizations, and how GAI can be used strategically to benefit all. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Computer Information Systems, Bentley University, 175 Forest St., Waltham, 02452, MA, United States; Information Systems, City University of Hong Kong, Tat Chee Ave, 83, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong",Artificial intelligence; Climate changes; Ethics; GAI and AI strategizing; Global South; Global warming; Social justice,,Viewpoint,Note,Human-AI interaction; sustainability,Organization; social,Worldwide,Normative,None; distributive justice; environmetal ethics; critical theory,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical; research agenda,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Relativism,Implicit
Papagiannidis E.; Mikalef P.; Conboy K.,Responsible artificial intelligence governance: A review and research framework,2025,Journal of Strategic Information Systems,,12,"The widespread and rapid diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) into all types of organizational activities necessitates the ethical and responsible deployment of these technologies. Various national and international policies, regulations, and guidelines aim to address this issue, and several organizations have developed frameworks detailing the principles of responsible AI. Nevertheless, the understanding of how such principles can be operationalized in designing, executing, monitoring, and evaluating AI applications is limited. The literature is disparate and lacks cohesion, clarity, and, in some cases, depth. Subsequently, this scoping review aims to synthesize and critically reflect on the research on responsible AI. Based on this synthesis, we developed a conceptual framework for responsible AI governance (defined through structural, relational, and procedural practices), its antecedents, and its effects. The framework serves as the foundation for developing an agenda for future research and critically reflects on the notion of responsible AI governance. © 2024 The Author(s)","Department of Computer Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway; School of Business & Economics, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland; Department of Technology Management, SINTEF Digital, Norway",AI implementation; AI lifecycle; Artificial intelligence; Governance practices; Responsible AI governance,Artificial intelligence implementation; Artificial intelligence lifecycle; Governance practice; International policies; National-policy; Organizational activities; Policy regulations; Rapid diffusion; Research frameworks; Responsible artificial intelligence governance,Review,Review,Responsible AI,Organization; social,Worldwide,Normative,None; principles of responsible innovation; value sensitive design; stakeholder theory,Conceptual analysis,Theoretical,Cross sectoral,0,0,0,1,Relativism; Constructivism,Implicit
